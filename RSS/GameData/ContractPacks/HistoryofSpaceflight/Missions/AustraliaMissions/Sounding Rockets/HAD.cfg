	description = Like its sister, HAT, the High Altitude Density rocket (HAD) was developed to participate in research on the density of the upper atmosphere already being carried out by Skylark. In addition to providing information on the temperature of the upper atmosphere, the glowing clouds produced by the Skylark grenades could also be tracked and photographed to provide information on atmospheric density at  different altitudes. Before the refinement of mass spectrometry techniques, this was the only satisfactory way to obtain data on the density of the upper atmosphere between 80-180km.  There were a total of 118 HAD flights from 1961-1969&br;&br;The HAD was a two stage all solid propellant sounding rocket. The first stage Gosling-1 motors produced a thrust of 124.0 kN, and the second stage LAPstar produced a thrust of 80 kN. The HAD had a height of 6.10 m, and a diameter of 0.26 m, and a mass of 300 kg. It could carry a payload of 16 kg to an average altitude of 120 km.
