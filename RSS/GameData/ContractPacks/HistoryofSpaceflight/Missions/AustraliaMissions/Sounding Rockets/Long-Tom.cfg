	description = In mid-1955, the USA and the USSR had both announced their intention to launch a satellite during the IGY (International Geophysical Year) from 1957-1958. In that same year, Britain and Australia’s Weapons Research Establishment (WRE) announced their IGY plans to launch sounding rockets for upper atmosphere research from the WRE-managed Woomera Rocket Range. Britain's Skylark rocket was the first successful series to launch at Woomera and soon after, Australia started development of their first sounding rocket, the Long-Tom. It was used between 1957 and the early 1960s when it was replaced by the High Altitude Density (HAD) and High Altitude Temperature (HAT) rockets.\n\nThe Long-Tom was a two stage all solid propellant sounding rocket. The first stage was composed of a cluster of 3 mayfly solid rockets, producing a total thrust of 190.0 kN. The second stage consisted of a single mayfly solid rocket, producing a thrust of 62 kN. The Long-Tom had a height of 8.30 m, a diameter of 0.47 m, and could reach an altitude of 100 km. It was first flown on October 1, 1957, at the Woomera Rocket Range in South Australia.
