	description = The Black Brant originated in a 1957 Canadian government requirement for a sounding rocket to characterize the ionosphere in order to improve military communications. Bristol Aerospace of Winnipeg, Manitoba was selected to design the rocket, while the Canadian Armament Research and Development Establishment (CARDE) was responsible for the propellant and filling. The prototype was called the Propulsion Test Vehicle. It was a relatively heavy rocket, since it was designed to stand up to the use of a wide range of engine burning time, propellant loadings and launch angles associated with fuel development. The lighter production version of the vehicle was renamed Black Brant. Later versions of Black Brant used a variety of booster and upper stages to supplement the original single-stage vehicle. There were a total of 16 Black-Brant-I flights from 1959-1963.&br;&br;The Black-Brant-I was a single stage solid rocket with a height of 7.41 m, a diameter of 0.26 m, and a mass of 830 kg. It had a thrust of 110 kN, and a payload of 68 kg, and a maximum altitude of 225 km.
