	description = The Black Brant III was the continuation of the sounding rocket program and was designed and produced by CARDE. This design provided a more economical approach to single-stage high altitude research when compared to the previous Black Brant models. There were a total of 55 Black Brant-III flights from 1962-1984. The first four tests flights of the Black Brant III ended with the loss of the vehicle. The highest altitude reached in the first four tests was 92 km.&br;&br;The Black Brant III had a height of 5.50 m, a diameter of 0.26 m, and a mass of 286 kg. It had a thrust of 49 kN, and a payload of 18 kg, and a maximum altitude of 177 km.
