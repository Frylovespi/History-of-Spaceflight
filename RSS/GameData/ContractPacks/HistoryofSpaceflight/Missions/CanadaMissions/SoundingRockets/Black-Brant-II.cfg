	description = The performance potential of the Black Brant I motor led to the development of a high altitude research vehicle with improved structural design, nose cone, and fins. This vehicle is known as the Black Brant II. As with the previous version of the rocket, the Black-Brant-II was a single stage, solid rocket propellant, sounding rocket. There were a total of 58 Black-Brant-II flights from 1960-1974. The Black-Brant-II had a height of 8.45 m, a diameter of 0.44 m, and a mass of 980 kg. It had a thrust of 89 kN, and a payload of 68 kg, and a maximum altitude of 275 km. 
         
	notes = Launch the Black-Brant-II sounding rocket and reach an altitude of 275 km on a sub-orbital trajectory.
	synopsis = The Black-Brant-II was first launched on October 12, 1960, at the Fort Churchill Launch site in Manitoba, Canada.
