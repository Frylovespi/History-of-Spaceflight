	description = Mars 1M-2 was designated Mars 1960B by NASA analysts and dubbed Marsnik 2 by the Western media. Like its predecessor, this spacecraft never reached Earth orbit. During the launch trajectory, there was a failure in the third-stage engine 290 seconds into the launch as a result of frozen kerosene in the pipeline feeding its turbopump (which prevented a valve from opening). The third and fourth stages, along with the 480-kg probes, burned up over Earth’s atmosphere over eastern Siberia. (The Mars flyby had been planned for 15 May 1961).
