	description = Luna 10 was the first spacecraft to go into orbit around the Moon, and the first human-made object to orbit any body beyond the Earth. The primary objectives were to achieve the first lunar orbit, gain experience in orbital operations, presumably as a precursor to astronaut orbital missions, and study the lunar environment. The launch was timed so that the spacecraft would come around on its first orbit just as the Twenty-third Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was convening for its morning session.  It had a mass of 245.0 kg.

	notes = Launch the Luna 10 spacecraft into a lunar orbit.
	synopsis = Luna 10 was launched by a Molniya-M 8K78M on March 31, 1966 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome.
