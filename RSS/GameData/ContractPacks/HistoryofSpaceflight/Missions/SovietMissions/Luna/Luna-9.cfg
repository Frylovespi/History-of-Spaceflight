	description = Luna 9 was the first spacecraft to achieve a lunar soft landing and to transmit photographic data from the Moon's surface to Earth, preceding the U.S. Surveyor 1 soft lander by about 4 months. The probe also proved that the lunar surface could support the weight of a lander and that an object would not sink into a loose layer of dust as some models predicted.

	notes = Launch the Luna 9 spacecraft to the Moon and land on its surface.
	synopsis =<color=yellow>Luna 9 was launched by a Molniya-M 8K78M on 31 January 1966 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome.</color>
