	description = This early Luna launch was believed to be an attempt to reach the Moon and impact on its surface. The second attempt to impact the Moon (after Luna Ye-1 #1) failed when, again, the probe never left Earth's atmosphere. The launch vehicle exploded after 104 seconds due to longitudinal resonant vibrations in the strap-on boosters. (Spacecraft Mass: ~360 kg (with upper stage). This mission was launched a few hours after the Pioneer 1 mission. Because Luna was on a faster trajectory, it would have reached the Moon first. Luna-E-1-No2 had a mass of 360 kg (including 3rd stage). One hundred and four seconds after launch, longitudinal resonance within the rocket's strap-on booster rockets caused the vehicle to disintegrate. This was the same problem which had caused the loss of Luna E-1 No.1 three weeks earlier.
