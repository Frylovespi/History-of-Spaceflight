	description = Luna 4 was the USSR's first successful spacecraft of their "second generation" lunar program. The spacecraft was also referred to as an automatic interplanetary station. Rather than being sent on a straight trajectory toward the Moon, the spacecraft was placed first in a 167 x 182 km Earth orbit and then was rocketed in a curving path towards the Moon. Luna 4 achieved the desired initial trajectory but during trans-lunar coast the Yupiter astro-navigation system failed (most likely due to thermal control problems) and the spacecraft could not be oriented properly for the planned mid-course correction burn. Communications were maintained, but Luna 4 missed the Moon by about 8400 km (sources give reports of 8336.2, 8451, and 8500 km) at 13:25 UT on 5 April 1963 and entered a 89 250 x 694 000 km equatorial Earth orbit. It had a mass of 361.0 kg.

	notes = Launch Luna 4 at the moon and end in a free return trajectory to orbit Earth.
