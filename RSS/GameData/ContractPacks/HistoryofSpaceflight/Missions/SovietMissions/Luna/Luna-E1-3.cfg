	description = This mission was the third failure in a row in Soviet attempts to send a Ye-1 lunar impact probe to the Moon. The spacecraft was intended to release 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) of sodium, in order to create a cloud of the metal which could be observed from Earth, allowing the spacecraft to be tracked. The thrust level of the core engine of the R-7 booster dropped abruptly at 245 seconds into the flight, leading eventually to premature engine cutoff. The payload never reached escape velocity.

	notes = Launch Luna E-1-3 and fail to reach the Moon.
