	description = Polyot 2 was the second of two spacecraft fitted with special controls to allow for maneuvrability in space, as a mission to test the propulsion of the new I2P coorbital ASAT satellite. The spacecraft was able to change inclination as well as apogee and perigee. It also carried scientific instruments, a telemetry system, and radio transmitters. It did not conduct any interception maneuvers. It had a mass of 600.0 kg.

	notes = Launch the Polyot 2 experimental propulsion spacecraft into a low Earth orbit.
