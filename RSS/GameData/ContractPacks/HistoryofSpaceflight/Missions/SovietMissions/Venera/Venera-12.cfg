	description = Venera 12, also designated 4V-1 No.361, was part of a dual mission to Venus, paired with Venera 11, launched in September 1978. Both spacecraft carried identical instrumentation. Different from the previous Venera missions, the flight platform continued on past Venus into a heliocentric orbit, after ejection of the lander probe. Near encounter with Venus occurred on December 21, 1978, at approximately 34,000 km altitude. The flight platform acted as a data relay for the descent craft for 110 minutes until it flew out of range and returned its own measurements on interplanetary space. The lander carried instruments to study the temperature and atmospheric and soil chemical composition. A device called Groza detected lightning on Venus. Both Venera 11 and Venera 12 had landers with two cameras, each designed for color imaging, but they failed to return data.

	notes = Launch the Venera 12 spacecraft and achieve intact landing on solid ground on @/targetBody, transmitting data from its surface.
