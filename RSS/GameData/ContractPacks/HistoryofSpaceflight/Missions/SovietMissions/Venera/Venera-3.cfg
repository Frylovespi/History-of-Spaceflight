         description = Venera 3 (meaning Venus 3) was a Venera program space probe that was built and launched by the Soviet Union to explore the surface of Venus. During 1965, the Central Committee, frustrated at the poor track record of Sergei Korolev's OKB-1 design bureau, reassigned the planetary probe program to the Lavochkin Bureau. In over two dozen attempts dating back to 1958, Luna 2 and Luna 3 were the only probes to complete all of their mission objectives. possibly crashed on Venus on 1 March 1966, possibly making Venera 3 the first space probe to hit the surface of another planet. However, its communications systems had failed before it reached Venus. Venera-3 was launched on a Molniya 8K78 rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on November 16, 1965.
