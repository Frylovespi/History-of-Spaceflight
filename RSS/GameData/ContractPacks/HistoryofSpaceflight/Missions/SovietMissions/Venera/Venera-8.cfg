	description = Venera 8, also designated 3V No.670, was one of a pair of Venus atmospheric lander probes designed for the spring 1972 launch window. The other mission (Kosmos 482) failed to leave Earth orbit. The objectives were to make a more sophisticated set of scientific measurements at the Venus surface, including studies of the Venus regolith. The lander probe was a spherical pressure vessel with a mass of 495 kg of similar design to the Venera 7 probe. Its instrumentation included temperature, pressure, and light sensors as well as an altimeter, anemometer, gamma-ray spectrometer, gas analyzer, and radio transmitters. The bus contained a cosmic ray detector, solar wind detector, and ultraviolet spectrometer.&br;&br;Before reaching Venus the probe interior was cooled to -15 degrees C. It separated from the bus on 22 July 1972 and entered the atmosphere a few hours later. Descent speed was reduced from 11 km/sec at entry to about 250 meters/s at 67 km altitude by aerobraking. The parachute opened in reefed mode at an altitude of 60 km, and a refrigeration system was used to cool the interior components. Venera 8 transmitted data during the descent from instrument turn-on at 50 km. At 30 km altitude the parachute was fully opened. A decrease in illumination was noted at 35 to 30 km altitude and wind speeds of less than 1 km/s were measured below 10 km. Venera 8 landed at 10 degrees south, 335 degrees east, about 500 km from the morning terminator on the day side. It continued to send back data for 63 minutes after landing before failing due to the harsh surface conditions.
