    description = Tyazhely Sputnik, (meaning Heavy Satellite), also known by its development name as Venera 1VA No.1, and in the West as Sputnik 7, was a Soviet spacecraft which was intended to be the first spacecraft to explore Venus. Due to a problem with its upper stage it failed to leave low Earth orbit. In order to avoid acknowledging the failure, the Soviet government instead announced that the entire spacecraft, including the upper stage, was a test of a "Heavy Satellite" which would serve as a launch platform for future missions. This resulted in the upper stage being considered a separate spacecraft, from which the probe was "launched", on several subsequent missions. The Venera probe had a mass of about 645 kg and was based on the Mars-1 spacecraft design. It was designed as a Venus atmospheric probe. It carried a 3-axis magnetometer, a variometer, and charged particle monitors. It also carried a small globe which held medallions and other commemorations of the mission.
