	description = Venera 6, also designated 2V (V-69) No.331, was identical to its twin Venera 5. The Venera 5 and Venera 6 spacecraft were launched 5 days apart in January 1969. The spacecraft were designed to make in-situ measurements as they descended through the Venusian atmosphere. Measurements included temperature, pressure, composition.&br;&br;The Venera 6 probe was released on 17 May 1969, 25,000 km from the planet. It entered the nightside atmosphere at 06:05 UT and deployed the parachute. The probe sent back readouts every 45 seconds for 51 minutes and ceased operation due the temperature and pressure effects at roughly 10 to 12 km altitude, over 5 degrees S, 23 degrees E.

	notes = Launch the Venera 6 spacecraft and impact on @/targetBody, transmitting data on its atmosphere on the way.
