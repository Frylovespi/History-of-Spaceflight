	description = Kosmos 97, also known as DS-U2-M No.1, was a technology demonstration satellite launched as part of the Dnepropetrovsk Sputnik program. Its primary mission was to test atomic clocks in space. These satellites experimentally confirmed that quantum frequency standards (atomic clocks) can work in vacuum, zero gravity, and other space flight environments. The data allowed continuing engineering development of onboard molecular oscillators in order to produce generic designs. Kosmos 97 was placed in an inclined Earth orbit with a perigee of 213 km, an apogee of 2144 km, an inclination of 49 degrees, and an orbital period of 108.3 minutes. The mission ended with the satellite decaying from orbit on April 2, 1967.
