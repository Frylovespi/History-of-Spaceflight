	description = Kosmos 94 was a Soviet optical-film return reconnaissance satellite launched in 1965. Kosmos 94 was a Zenit-4 type Soviet surveillance satellite, which was nearly identical to the Vostok spacecraft. Kosmos 94 was placed in a low Earth orbit with a perigee of 205 km, an apogee of 271 km, an inclination of 65 degrees, and an orbital period of 89.3 minutes. It conducted an eight day reconnaissance mission before deorbiting and landing by parachute in Siberia.
