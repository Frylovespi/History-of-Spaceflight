	description = Kosmos 93, also known as DS-U2-V No.1, was a Soviet scientific satellite launched as part of the Dnepropetrovsk Sputnik program. These satellites measured the electron concentration in the vicinity of the spacecraft, as well as properties of the ionosphere in the path of coherent-wave propagation from the spacecraft to an observation point. It had a mass of 305 kg. Kosmos 69 was placed in a low Earth orbit with a perigee of 216 km, an apogee of 513 km, an inclination of 48.4 degrees, and an orbital period of 91.7 minutes. Contact with the satellite was lost on December 16, 1965, and it decayed from orbit on January 3, 1966.
