	description = Kosmos 66, also known as Zenit-2 27, was a Soviet optical-film return reconnaissance satellite launched in 1965. Kosmos 66 was the twenty-seventh of eighty-one satellites in this series to be launched. It had a mass of 4,730 kg and was launched by a Vostok-2 rocket. Kosmos 66 was placed in a low Earth orbit with a perigee of 200 km, an apogee of 278 km, an inclination of 65 degrees, and an orbital period of 89.28 minutes. On 15 May 1965, after eight days in orbit, the satellite was deorbited so that its return capsule could be recovered and its photos analysed, however the capsule was lost after its parachute failed to deploy.

	synopsis = It was launched on a Vostok-2 rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on March 25, 1965, and conducted an eight day mission and was deorbited and landed by parachute.
	notes = Launch the Kosmos-66 reconnaissance satellite into orbit and fail to recover the capsule intact.
