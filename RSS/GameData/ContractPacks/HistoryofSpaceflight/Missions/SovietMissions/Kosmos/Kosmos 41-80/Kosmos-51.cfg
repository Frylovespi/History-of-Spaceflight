	description = Kosmos 51, also known as DS-MT-No.3, was a technology demonstration satellite with a  primary mission to demonstrate an electric gyrodyne orientation system. It had a secondary scientific research payload that included instruments to study cosmic rays and the luminosity of space. Kosmos 51 was placed into a low Earth orbit with a perigee of 258 km, an apogee of 537 km, an inclination of 48.8 degrees, and an orbital period of 92.6 minutes. It decayed from orbit on November 14, 1965. Kosmos 51 was the last of three DS-MT satellites to be launched.

	synopsis = <color=yellow>Kosmos 51 was launched by a Kosmos-2l 63S1 on December 9, 1964 from the Mayak Launch Complex at Kapustin Yar.</color>
