	description = Kosmos 50, also known as Zenit-2 No.25, was a Soviet optical-film return reconnaissance satellite. Kosmos 50 was the twenty-third of eighty-one satellites in this series to be launched. Kosmos 50 was placed in a low Earth orbit with a perigee of 187 km, an apogee of 232 km, an inclination of 51.2 degrees, and an orbital period of 88.69 minutes. On 5 November 1964, after eight days in orbit, an attempt was made to deorbit the satellite so that its photographs could be developed and analyzed. After its retrorockets failed to fire, the satellite was commanded to self-destruct to ensure it could not fall into enemy hands. Ninety-five pieces of debris were catalogued, which decayed from orbit between the 8th and 17th of November.
