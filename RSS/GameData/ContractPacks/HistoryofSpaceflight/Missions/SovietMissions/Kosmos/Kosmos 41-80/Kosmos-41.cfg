	description = Kosmos 41, also known as Molniya 1-L, was a Molniya 1 type military communications satellite. These satellites were placed into highly eccentric elliptical orbits known as Molniya orbits. The Molniya satellites feature a unique configuration. The pressurized, three-axis stabilized KAUR-2 satellite bus features six non-articulated solar arrays and is operated in a sun-pointed mode. The antennas are mounted on two telescopic arms and are pointable. Each antenna features an optical tracking system which provides information to direct one of the two antennas to the Earth. The Molniya-1 satellites carry the Alfa communications payload consisting of 5 transponders. It was used for bidirectional telephone, telegram or fax transmissions in the Orbita network or alternatively for TV broadcast. Kosmos 41 was a partial failure due to a guidance malfunction in the Molniya spacecraft leaving the satellite in an incorrect but still functional orbit. 

	synopsis = Kosmos 41 was launched by a Molniya 8K78 on August 22, 1964 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome.
