	description = Kosmos 52, also known as Zenit-2 No.26, was a Soviet optical-film return reconnaissance satellite. Kosmos 52 was the twenty-fourth of eighty-one satellites in this series to be launched. Kosmos 52 was placed in a low Earth orbit with a perigee of 200 km, an apogee of 295 km, an inclination of 64.9 degrees, and an orbital period of 89.45 minutes. On 19 January 1965, eight days after launch, Kosmos 52 was deorbited so that its return capsule could be recovered and its photos developed and analyzed.
