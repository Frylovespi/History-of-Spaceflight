	description = Kosmos 68, also known as Zenit-2 No.28, was a Soviet Zenit 2 type optical-film return reconnaissance satellite launched on a Vostok-2 by the Soviet Union in 1965. Kosmos 68 was the twenty-eighth of eighty-one satellites in this series to be launched. Kosmos 68 was placed in a low Earth orbit with a perigee of 200 km, an apogee of 319 km, an inclination of 65 degrees, and an orbital period of 89.7 minutes. On 23 June 1965, after eight days in orbit, the satellite was deorbited with its return capsule descending by parachute for recovery in Siberia.
