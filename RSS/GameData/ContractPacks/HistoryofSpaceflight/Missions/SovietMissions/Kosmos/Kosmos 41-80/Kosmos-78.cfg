	description = Kosmos 78, also known as Zenit-2 No.30, was a Soviet optical-film return reconnaissance satellite launched in 1965. Kosmos 78 was the thirtieth of eighty-one satellites in this series to be launched. Kosmos 78 was placed in a low Earth orbit with a perigee of 199 km, an apogee of 304 km, an inclination of 68.9 degrees, and an orbital period of 89.53 minutes. On 22 August 1965, after eight days of operation the satellite was deorbited, with its return capsule descending by parachute for recovery in Siberia.
