	description = Kosmos 76, also known as DS-P1-Yu No.3, was a technology demonstration satellite with a primary mission to demonstrate technologies for future Soviet satellite military satellites. It was primarily used as a radar calibration target for tests of early warning radars. This series was the operational follow on to the DS-P1 series. They were used to calibrate the Dnestr (NATO-codename: 'Hen House') space surveillance and early warning radars. These satellites were built on a dodecahedral structure, which carried solar cells. The satellite was covered by a spherical mesh reflector transparent for light-region waves and non-transparent for decimetric and metric radio waves.

	synopsis = Kosmos 76 was launched by a Kosmos-2l 63S1 from the Mayak Launch Complex at Kapustin Yar on July 23, 1965.
