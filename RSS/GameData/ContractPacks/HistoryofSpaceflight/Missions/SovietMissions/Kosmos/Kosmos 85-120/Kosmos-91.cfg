	description = Kosmos 91 was a Soviet optical-film return reconnaissance satellite. Kosmos 91 was a Zenit-4 type Soviet surveillance satellite. The basic design of the Zenit satellites was similar to the Vostok manned spacecraft, sharing the return and service modules. The capsule contained the camera system, its film, recovery beacons, parachutes and a destruct charge. Kosmos 91 was placed in a low Earth orbit with a perigee of 198 km, an apogee of 264 km, an inclination of 65 degrees, and an orbital period of 89.8 minutes. It conducted an eight day reconnaissance mission before deorbiting and landing by parachute in Siberia.

	notes = Launch the Kosmos 91 reconnaissance satellite into a low Earth orbit and recover the capsule intact after 8 days.
