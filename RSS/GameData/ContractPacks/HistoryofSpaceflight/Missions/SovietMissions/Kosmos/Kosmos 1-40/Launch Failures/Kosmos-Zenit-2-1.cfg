	description = Zenit 2 1 was the first attempt to launch a Zenit-2 reconnaissance satellite atop a Vostok launch vehicle. The basic design of the Zenit satellites was similar to the Vostok manned spacecraft, sharing the return and service modules. It consisted of a spherical re-entry capsule 2.3 meters (7.5 ft) in diameter with a mass of around 2,400 kilograms (5,300 lb). This capsule contained the camera system, its film, recovery beacons, parachutes and a destruct charge. Launch and the first two stages performed as expected, but there was a fault in the third stage. The engine failed to ignite and the spacecraft was destroyed using its destruct charge.
	
	notes = Launch Zenit-2 1 and suffer a failure in your third stage.
