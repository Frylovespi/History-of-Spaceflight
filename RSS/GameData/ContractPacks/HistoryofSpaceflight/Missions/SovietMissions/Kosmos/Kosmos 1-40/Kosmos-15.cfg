	description = Kosmos 15, also known as Zenit-2 8, was a Soviet optical-film return reconnaissance satellite. Kosmos 15 was the ninth of eighty-one satellites in this series to be launched. In addition to reconnaissance, Kosmos 15 carried an experiment package to measure radiation levels in its environment and was also used for meteorological research. It was launched on a Vostok-2 rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on April 22, 1963. It conducted a five day mission before being deorbited and landed by parachute.&br;&br;Kosmos 15 was placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 357 km, a perigee of 160 km , an inclination of 64.9 degrees, and an orbital period of 89.67 minutes. It was deorbited on April 27, 1963.
