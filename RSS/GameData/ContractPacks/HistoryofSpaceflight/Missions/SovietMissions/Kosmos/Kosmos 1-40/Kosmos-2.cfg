It was the fourth flight of the Kosmos-2I, and the second to successfully reach orbit. Kosmos 2 was placed into a low Earth orbit with a perigee of 207 km, an apogee of 1,485 km, 49 degrees of inclination, and an orbital period of 101.8 minutes. Kosmos 2 was a 1MS satellite, the first of two to be launched. The second was launched on 25 October 1962, but failed to reach orbit. The 1MS was the first of two types of MS satellite to be launched, and was succeeded by the 2MS satellite. It decayed on 20 August 1963.It had a mass of 285 kg.
