    description = Kosmos-DS-1-No1 was the first attempt to launch a DS 1 technology test version of the DS satellite atop a Kosmos-63S1 small launch vehicle. This was the first test of the new Kosmos-63S1 low cost, small payload, launcher. The Kosmos 63S1 was a fraction of the cost to assemble and launch than the R-7's variants that the Soviet Union had launched in the past. It had a gross mass of just under 50,000 kg, a height of 31.0 m, and a diameter of 1.6 m. It could carry a 300 kg payload to 250 km orbit. The first stage RD-214 produced a thrust of 730.50 kN. The second stage RD-119 produced a thrust of 105.51 kN. The booster didn't reach orbital velocity due to the failure of an acceleration integrator in the velocity regulation control.
	
	notes = Kosmos DS 1 No. 1 was launched atop a Kosmos-63S1 rocket from the Kapustin Yar launch site on October 27, 1961.
