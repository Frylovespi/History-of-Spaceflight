	description = Kosmos 36, also known as DS-P1-Yu, was a prototype radar target satellite for anti-ballistic missile tests launched by a Kosmos-2l 63S1 on July 30, 1964 from Pad 2 of the Mayak Launch Complex at Kapustin Yar. It was launched by the Soviet Union as part of the Dnepropetrovsk Sputnik program. It had a mass of 325 kg and was built by the Yuzhnoye Design Bureau. Kosmos 36 was the first of seventy-nine DS-P1-Yu satellites to be launched, of which all but seven were successful.&br;&br;Kosmos 36 was placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 476 km, a perigee of 253 km, an inclination of 49 degrees, and an orbital period of 91.83 minutes. It decayed from orbit on February 28, 1965.
