	description = Kosmos 31, also known as DS-MT 2, was a technology demonstration and gyroscopic research satellite launched by the Soviet Union on June 6 1964. It had a mass of 325.0 kg and was launched from a Kosmos-2l 63S1 rocket from Pad 2 of the Mayak Launch Complex at Kapustin Yar. Its primary mission was to test and electric gyrodyne orientation system for future Soviet spacecraft. It also carried a secondary payload of scientific instruments to study cosmic rays. Kosmos 31 was the second of three DS-MT satellites to be launched. The first was lost in a launch failure in June 1963, and the third was Kosmos 51, which was launched in December 1964.&br;&br;Kosmos 31 was placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 492 km, a perigee of 222 km, an inclination of 49 degrees, and an orbital period of 91.6 minutes. It decayed from orbit on October 20, 1964.
