	description = Kosmos 4, also known as Zenit-2 No.2 and occasionally in the West as Sputnik 14, was the first Soviet reconnaissance satellite to successfully reach orbit. It was the fourth satellite to be designated under the Kosmos system, and the second Soviet attempt to launch a reconnaissance satellite, the previous attempt having failed after one of the carrier rockets' engines shut down prematurely. It conducted a four day mission and then was deorbited and landed by parachute.&br;&br;Kosmos 4 was a Zenit-2 satellite, a reconnaissance satellite derived from the Vostok spacecraft used for manned flights. To conceal their nature, all flights were given the public Kosmos designation. The next Zenit launch attempt, scheduled for May but delayed to June, failed to reach orbit, but the next launch successfully reached orbit as Kosmos 7.
	
	notes = Launch the Kosmos 4 reconnaissance satellite into orbit and recover the capsule after 4 days in orbit.
