	description = Kosmos 3, also known as 2MS #1 and occasionally in the West as Sputnik 13, was a scientific research and technology demonstration satellite launched by the Soviet Union in 1962. It was the third satellite to be designated under the Kosmos system, and the second spacecraft to be launched as part of the MS program, after Kosmos 2 which was launched 18 days earlier. Its primary missions were to develop systems for future satellites, and to record data about cosmic rays and radiation. It was the fifth flight of the Kosmos-2I, and the third to successfully reach orbit. Kosmos 3 was placed into a low Earth orbit with a perigee of 204 km, an apogee of 1,142 km, 49 degrees of inclination, and an orbital period of 93.8 minutes. It decayed on 17 October 1962. It had a mass of 330 kg.
