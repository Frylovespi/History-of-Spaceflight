	description = Kosmos 11, also known as DS-A1 No.1, was a technology demonstration and research satellite launched by the Soviet Union on August 18 1962. It had a mass of 315.0 kg and was launched on a Kosmos-2l 63S1 rocket from the Mayak Launch Complex at Kapustin Yar. Its primary mission was to test technology for future Soviet spacecraft.&br;&br;Kosmos 11 was placed into a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 858 km , a perigee of 240 km, and an inclination of 48.9 degrees. It decayed on 18 May 1964. Kosmos 11 was the first of seven DS-A1 satellites to be launched.
