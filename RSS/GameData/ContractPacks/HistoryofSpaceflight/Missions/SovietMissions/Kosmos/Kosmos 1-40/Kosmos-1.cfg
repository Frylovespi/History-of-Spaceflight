    description = Kosmos 1, also known as Sputnik 11 in the West, was a technology demonstration and ionospheric research satellite launched by the Soviet Union. It was the first satellite to be designated under the Kosmos system, and the first spacecraft launched as part of the Dnepropetrovsk Sputnik program to successfully reach orbit. Its primary missions were to measure the performance of its carrier rocket, and to conduct research into the ionosphere. It was the third flight of the Kosmos 2L, and the first to successfully reach orbit. It was also the first Kosmos rocket of any type to successfully place a satellite into orbit. Kosmos 1 had a mass of 315 kg.
