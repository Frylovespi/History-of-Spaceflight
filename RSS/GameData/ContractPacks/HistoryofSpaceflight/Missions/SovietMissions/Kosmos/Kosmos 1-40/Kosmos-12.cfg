It was a Zenit-2 type spacecraft, and was the seventh of eighty-one Zenit-2's to be launched. It was launched on a Vostok-2 rocket, serial number T15000-10, from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on December 22, 1962. Kosmos 12 was operated in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 386 km, a perigee of 199 km, with inclination of 64.9 degrees and an orbital period of 90.37 minutes. On 30 December 1962 the spacecraft was deorbited, with its return capsule descending by parachute for recovery. It conducted an eight day mission and was deorbited and landed by parachute.
