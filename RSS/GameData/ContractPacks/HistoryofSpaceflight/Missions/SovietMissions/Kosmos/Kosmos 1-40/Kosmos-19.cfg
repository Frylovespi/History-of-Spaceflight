	description = Kosmos 19, also known as DS-P1 No. 3, was a prototype radar target satellite for anti-ballistic missile tests. It was launched on a Kosmos-2l 63S1 from pad 2 of the Mayak Launch Complex at Kapustin Yar in the Soviet Union on August 6, 1963. Its primary mission was to demonstrate the necessary technologies for radar tracking of spacecraft, which would allow future satellites to function as targets. It had a mass of 355.0 kg.&br;&br;Kosmos 19 was placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 487 km, a perigee of 267 km, an inclination of 49 degrees, and an orbital period of 92.2 minutes. It decayed from orbit on 30 March 1964.
