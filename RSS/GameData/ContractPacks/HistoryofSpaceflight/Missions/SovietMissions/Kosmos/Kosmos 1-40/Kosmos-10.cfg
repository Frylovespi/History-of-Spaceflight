	description = Kosmos 10, also known as Zenit-2 No.5, was the fourth Soviet reconnaissance satellite to successfully reach orbit. It was launched on a Vostok-2 rocket (s/n T15000-03) from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome on October 21, 1962. This mission also carried a small scientific payload for research into radiation ti support the Vostok program. This was also the last of Zenit-2 four day test missions. All future Zenit-2 missions were a minimum of eight days in orbit.&br;&br;Kosmos 10 was placed into a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 376 km, a perigee of 178 km, an inclination of 64.9 degrees, and an orbital period of 90 minutes. It conducted a four-day mission, before being deorbited and landing by parachute on 21 October. 

	notes = Launch the Kosmos 10 reconnaissance satellite into orbit and recover the capsule after 4 days.
