	description = Kosmos 7,  also known as Zenit-2 4 and in the West as Sputnik 17, was the second Soviet reconnaissance satellite to successfully reach orbit. This was also the first successful launch of the Vostok-2 carrier rocket. Kosmos 7 was a Zenit-2 series satellite, a reconnaissance satellite nearly identical to the Vostok spacecraft used in the manned flight program.&br;&br;Kosmos 7 was placed into a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 356 km, a perigee of 197 km, and an inclination of 64.9 degrees. It conducted a four day mission and then was deorbited and landed by parachute.

	notes = Launch the Kosmos 7 reconnaissance satellite into orbit and recover the capsule after 4 days.
