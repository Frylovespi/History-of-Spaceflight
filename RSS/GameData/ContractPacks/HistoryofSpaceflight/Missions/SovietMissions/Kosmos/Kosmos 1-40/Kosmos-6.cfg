	description = Kosmos 6, also known as DS-P1 1 and occasionally in the West as Sputnik 16, was a prototype radar target satellite for ballistic missile tests launched by the Soviet Union in 1962. Its mission was to demonstrate the technologies for the radar tracking of a spacecraft, which would allow future satellites to function as targets. It was manufactured by Yuzhnoye, and was that bureau's first solar-powered satellite.&br;&br;Kosmos 6 was placed into a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 348 km, a perigee of 261 km, and an inclination of 48.9 degrees, It decayed on 8 September 1962. It had a mass of 355 kg.
