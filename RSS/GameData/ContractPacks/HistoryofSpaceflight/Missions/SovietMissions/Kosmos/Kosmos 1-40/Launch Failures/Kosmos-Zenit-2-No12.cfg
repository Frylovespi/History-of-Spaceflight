	description = Zenit-2 No. 12 was the twelfth attempt to launch a Zenit-2 reconnaissance satellite atop a Vostok-2 launch vehicle from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on July 10, 1963. The basic design of the Zenit satellites was similar to the Vostok manned spacecraft, sharing the return and service modules. It consisted of a spherical re-entry capsule 2.3 meters (7.5 ft) in diameter with a mass of around 2,400 kilograms (5,300 lb). This capsule contained the camera system, its film, recovery beacons, parachutes and a destruct charge. 1.9 seconds after launch the core engine shut down and the rocket fell back to the pad. Again the pad was severely damaged.

	notes = Launch Zenit-2 No. 12 and fail to clear the pad.
