	description = Kosmos 5, also known as 2MS #2 and occasionally in the West as Sputnik 15, was a scientific research and technology demonstration satellite launched by the Soviet Union in 1962. It was the fifth satellite to be designated under the Kosmos system, and the third spacecraft to be launched as part of the MS program, after Kosmos 2 and Kosmos 3. Its primary missions were to develop systems for future satellites, and to record data about artificial radiation around the Earth. It had a mass of 280 kg.&br;&br;Kosmos 5 was placed into a low Earth orbit with a perigee of 192 km, an apogee of 1,578 km, 49.1 degrees of inclination, and an orbital period of 102.6 minutes. It decayed on 2 May 1963, after nearly a year in orbit. Kosmos 5 was among several satellites inadvertently damaged or destroyed by the Starfish Prime high-altitude nuclear test on July 9, 1962 and subsequent radiation belt.
