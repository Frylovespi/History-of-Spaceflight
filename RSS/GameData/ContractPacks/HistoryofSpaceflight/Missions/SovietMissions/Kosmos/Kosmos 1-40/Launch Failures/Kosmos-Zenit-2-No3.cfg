         description = Kosmos-Zenit-2-No3 was the third attempt to launch a Zenit-2 reconnaissance satellite atop a Vostok launch vehicle. The basic design of the Zenit satellites was similar to the Vostok manned spacecraft, sharing the return and service modules. It consisted of a spherical re-entry capsule 2.3 meters (7.5 ft) in diameter with a mass of around 2,400 kilograms (5,300 lb). This capsule contained the camera system, its film, recovery beacons, parachutes and a destruct charge. Shortly after launch, after reaching an altitude of 300 m, it exploded and did enough damage to put the launch complex out of operation for a month. Therefore the Vostok 3/4 launches could not take place until the end of July at the earliest. It was launched atop a Vostok rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on June 1, 1962.
