	description = Molniya 1-04 was a first-generation Russian communication satellite orbited to test and perfect a system of radio communications and television broadcasting using earth satellites as active transponders and to experiment with the system in practical use. The basic function of the satellite was to relay television programs and long-distance two-way multichannel telephone, photo-telephone, and telegraph links from Moscow to the various standard ground receiving stations in the 'Orbita' system. The satellite was in the form of a hermetically sealed cylinder with conical ends -- one end contained the orbital correcting engine and a system of micro-jets, and the other end contained externally mounted solar and earth sensors. It had a mass of 998.0 kg.
