	description = Vostok 3, the third spacecraft in the USSR's manned flight series, was piloted by cosmonaut Andriyan G. Nikolayev. The spacecraft consisted of a nearly spherical cabin covered with ablative material. There were three small portholes and external radio antennas. Radios, a life support system, instrumentation, and an ejection seat were contained in the manned cabin. This cabin was attached to a service module that carried chemical batteries, orientation rockets, the main retro system, and added support equipment for the total system. This module was separated from the manned cabin on reentry. The flight lasted approximately 94 hr, during which 64 orbits were completed. The spacecraft flew in an orbit close to Vostok 4 for 70 hr 28 min. As with the other Vostok spacecraft, cabin TV photography was obtained. A series of scientific and biomedical experiments was performed during the flight. The spacecraft landed in the Karaganda region.

	notes = Launch the Vostok 3 capsule into orbit and return safely to Earth after 4 days.
