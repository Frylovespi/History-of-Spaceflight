	description = Electron 1 was launched with Elektron 2 by a single launch vehicle in order to perform simultaneous investigations of the external and internal zones of the earth's radiation belt. Electron 1 had a cylindrical body that was 0.75 m in diameter and 1.3 m long and from which antennas and six solar cell panels were extended. was identical to Elektron 1 except it omitted the solar array and thus contained extra battery weight. The spacecrafts were placed into an eccentric orbits that enabled them to study the internal zone of the radiation belt. They were equipped with micrometeorite detectors, a mass spectrometer, a proton detector, and instruments for recording the corpuscular emission and energy spectrum of electrons. A memory device was included so that observations over several orbits could be obtained by USSR telemetry stations when the satellite was within communications range. Elektron 1 had a mass of 350 kg, and Elektron 2 had a mass of 460kg.
