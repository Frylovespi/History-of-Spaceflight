	description = Voskhod 1, which carried three men into space, was the first multi-manned flight. The crew members were cosmonauts Vladimir M. Komarov, command pilot, Boris B. Yegorov, physician, and Konstatin P. Feoktisov, scientist. This mission was designed to test the new multi-seat spacecraft, to investigate the capacity of a group of cosmonauts who were specialists in different disciplines of science and engineering, to conduct physical and technical experiments, and to perform an extensive medical-biological investigation program. During the flight, live TV pictures were returned. The life-support systems of the space cabin were felt to be reliable enough to allow the crew to wear overalls instead of the cumbersome spacesuits and helmets. The mission was a success, and a large amount of scientific data was obtained.

	notes = Launch 3 Cosmonauts in the Voskhod 1 capsule into low Earth orbit and return home safely after 1 day.
