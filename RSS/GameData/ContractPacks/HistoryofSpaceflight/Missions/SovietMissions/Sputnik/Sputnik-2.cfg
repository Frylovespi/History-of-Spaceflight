	description = Sputnik 2 (Satellite 2), or Prosteyshiy Sputnik 2 (PS-2, Russian: Elementary Satellite 2)) was the second spacecraft launched into Earth orbit, and the first to carry a living animal, a dog named Laika. Sputnik 2 was a 4-meter high cone-shaped capsule with a base diameter of 2 meters that weighed around 500 kg, though it was not designed to separate from the rocket core that brought it to orbit, bringing the total mass in orbit to 7.79 tons. It contained several compartments for radio transmitters, a telemetry system, a programming unit, a regeneration and temperature control system for the cabin, and scientific instruments. A separate sealed cabin contained the dog Laika. Early telemetry indicated Laika was agitated but alive and well, although the cabin temperature had already reached 43 degrees Celsius by the third orbit. Biometric telemetry failed sometime after the fourth orbit. It was initially claimed that Laika had survived in orbit for a week; decades later, Russian sources revealed that Laika likely had survived only a few hours in orbit before dying from overheating.
