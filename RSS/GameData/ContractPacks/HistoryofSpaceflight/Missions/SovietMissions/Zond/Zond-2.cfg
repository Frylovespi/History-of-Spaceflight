         description = Zond 2 was an automatic interplanetary station launched from a Tyazheliy Sputnik (1964-078A) in Earth parking orbit towards Mars to test space-borne systems and to carry out scientific investigations. The probe carried a descent craft and the same instruments as the Mars 1 flyby spacecraft: a magnetometer probe, television photographic equipment, a spectroreflectometer, radiation sensors (gas-discharge and scintillation counters), charged particle traps, a spectrograph to study ozone absorption bands, and a micro-meteoroid instrument. One of the two solar panels failed due to a broken tug cord, so only half the anticipated power was available to the spacecraft. Controllers were able to finally get the second solar panel to open on 15 December 1964 by firing the plasma engines to shake it free, but this was too late for the crucial first mid-course maneuver. After a putative (but unconfirmed) mid-course maneuver on 17 February 1965, communications with the spacecraft were lost in early May, 1965. The spacecraft flew by Mars on 6 August 1965 at a distance of 1500 km and a relative speed of 5.62 km/s. Zond-2 was launched on a Molniya 8K78 rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on November 30, 1964.
