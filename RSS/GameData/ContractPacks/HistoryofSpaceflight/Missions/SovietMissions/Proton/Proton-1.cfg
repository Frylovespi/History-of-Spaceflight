	description = Proton-1 was a Soviet magneto-spheric research satellite that contained physics experiments to investigate ultra-high-energy cosmic particles. It carried instruments to study super-high energy cosmic particles. The instruments were carried in a pressurized compartment and consisted of ionization calorimeters to study the energy of particles in the 1013 eV range and determining the intensity and energy spectrum of galactic electrons, and measuring the intensity and energy spectrum of cosmic gamma-rays over 50 MeV. It also served as a test for the Proton rocket.
