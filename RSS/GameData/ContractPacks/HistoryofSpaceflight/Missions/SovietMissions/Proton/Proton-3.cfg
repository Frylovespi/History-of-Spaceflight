	description = Proton 3 was the third in a series of spacecraft from which cylindrical payloads containing instruments for studying cosmic rays of energies up to 10 to the 13 eV were launched. Proton 3 also studied the nuclear interaction of particles in the range of 10 to the 12 eV. This payload decayed after 72 days in orbit.
