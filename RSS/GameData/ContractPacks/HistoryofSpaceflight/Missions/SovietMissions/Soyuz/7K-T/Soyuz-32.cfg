	description = Soyuz 32 was a 1979 Soviet crewed space flight to the Salyut 6 space station. It was the eighth mission to and seventh successful docking at the orbiting facility. The Soyuz 32 crew was the third long-duration crew to man the space station. Cosmonauts Vladimir Lyakhov and Valery Ryumin spent 175 days in space, setting a new space endurance record. Because of the failure of a visiting crew to successfully dock and the resultant decision to send an uncrewed Soyuz craft as a replacement return vehicle, the Soyuz 32 crew had no visitors in the Salyut 6 space station.
	
    notes = Launch Soyuz 32 to the third long duration mission onboard Salyut-6.
