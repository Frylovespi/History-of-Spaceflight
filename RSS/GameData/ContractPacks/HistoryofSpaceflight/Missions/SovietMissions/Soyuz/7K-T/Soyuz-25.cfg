	description = Soyuz 25 was a 1977 Soviet crewed space flight, the first to the new Salyut 6 space station, which had been launched 10 days earlier. However, the mission was aborted when cosmonauts Vladimir Kovalyonok and Valery Ryumin failed to engage the docking latches of the station despite five attempts. Lacking sufficient fuel to attempt a dock at the other end of the station and with battery power for only two days, they returned to Earth.&br;&br;The problem was traced later to a faulty mechanism on the Soyuz; this was not discovered until after the Soyuz 26 flight performed an EVA to inspect the second docking port on Salyut 6. The failure led to a new rule whereby every crew had to have at least one person aboard who had previously flown in space. This resulted in the all-rookie backup crew of Aleksandr Ivanchenkov and Yuri Romanenko being paired with veteran cosmonauts for future missions. The rule was not relaxed until 1994 and Soyuz TM-19.
