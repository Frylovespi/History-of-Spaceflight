	description = Soyuz 34 was a 1979 Soviet uncrewed space flight to the Salyut 6 space station. It was sent to supply the resident crew a reliable return vehicle after the previous flight, Soyuz 33, suffered an engine failure. Mission control decided to re-design the engine used on Soyuz craft as a result of the Soyuz 33 failure, and to return the Soyuz 32 craft which transported Vladimir Lyakhov and Valery Ryumin to the space station to earth uncrewed as it had the same suspect engine as Soyuz 33. Soyuz 34 successfully returned the crew to earth 73 days after launching.
	
    notes = Launch the unmanned Soyuz 34 to dock with Salyut-6, so the crew can be returned safely.
    synopsis = <color=yellow>Soyuz 34 was launched by a Soyuz-U rocket on June 6, 1979 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome.</color>
