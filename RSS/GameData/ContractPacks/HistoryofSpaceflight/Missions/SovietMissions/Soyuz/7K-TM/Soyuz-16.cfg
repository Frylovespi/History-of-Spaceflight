	description = Soyuz 16 was a 1974 manned test flight for a joint Soviet-US space flight which culminated in the Apollo-Soyuz mission in July, 1975. The two-man Soviet crew tested a docking ring and other systems to be used in the joint flight. Early concepts for a joint flight included docking a Soyuz craft to the American Skylab space station, or an Apollo vehicle docking with a Salyut space station. Once the Americans abandoned their Skylab station in 1974, the Apollo-Salyut concept seemed to be the logical choice, but since the Soviets had started to develop a universal docking adapter for the mission and feared having to publicly reveal details of their military-focused Salyut missions, the two powers opted to link a Soyuz spacecraft with an Apollo spacecraft. Three test flights of an uncrewed version of the ASTP spacecraft were flown: Cosmos 638, launched 3 April 1974; Cosmos 652, launched 15 May 1974; and Cosmos 672, launched 12 August 1974. These three flights, and Soyuz 16, were all launched with an improved version of a Soyuz booster.
