	description = Soyuz T-7 was the third Soviet space mission to the Salyut 7 space station. Crew member Svetlana Savitskaya was the first woman in space in almost twenty years, since Valentina Tereshkova who flew in 1963 on Vostok 6. Savitskaya was given the orbital module of Soyuz T-7 for privacy. The Soyuz T-7 crew delivered experiments and mail from home to the Elbrus crew. On August 21 the five cosmonauts traded seat liners between the Soyuz Ts. The Dniepers undocked in Soyuz T-5, leaving the newer Soyuz T-7 spacecraft for the long-duration crew.
	
    notes = Launch Soyuz T-7 to another mission onboard Salyut-7, replacing Soyuz T-5 as the spacecraft attached to the station.
