	description = Soyuz T-8 was a crewed mission to the Salyut 7 space station in 1983. Shortly into the mission, the spacecraft failed to dock with the space station due to an incident involving an antenna being torn off the craft by the protective launch shroud. After a fuel-consuming attempt made in darkness for an optical rendezvous with Salyut 7 resulted in an abort in order to avoid collision, it was decided to de-orbit T-8 two days into the mission in order to ensure that the spacecraft had a sufficient amount of propellant for the de-orbit maneuver. After de-orbiting, landing of the craft occurred normally.
	
    notes = Launch Soyuz T-8 to Salyut-7, but fail to dock and return home.
    synopsis = <color=yellow>Soyuz T-8 was launched by a Soyuz-U rocket on April 20, 1983 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome.</color>
