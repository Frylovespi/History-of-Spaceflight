	description = Soyuz T-10 was the fifth expedition to Salyut 7. It was visited by 6th and 7th expeditions. The three-person Mayak crew entered the darkened Salyut 7 station carrying flashlights. The cosmonauts commented on the burnt-metal odor of the drogue docking unit. By 17 February, Salyut 7 was fully reactivated, and the cosmonauts had settled into a routine. Physician Oleg Atkov did household chores and monitored his own health and that of his colleagues, who conducted experiments. During the previous year a fuel line on the station had ruptured. Kizim and Solovyov carried out three EVAs to try to fix the problem during the mission.
	
    notes = Launch Soyuz T-10 to another long duration mission onboard Salyut-7 and perform an EVA from the station.
