	description = Soyuz T-11 was the 6th expedition to Salyut 7, and carried the first Indian cosmonaut to the Salyut 7 station. Rakesh Sharma, aboard Salyut 7 for 7 days, 21 hours, and 40 minutes, conducted an Earth observation program concentrating on India. He also did life sciences and materials processing experiments, including silicium fusing tests. He is also reported to have experimented with practicing yoga to deal with the effects of prolonged orbital spaceflight.&br;&br;Salyut 7 was uncrewed after the undocking of Soyuz T-11 in October 1984 until Soyuz T-13 docked with the station in June 1985. Salyut 7 developed problems during the uncrewed time, which meant that the crew of Soyuz T-13 had to perform a manual docking and do repairs to the station.
	
    notes = Launch Soyuz T-11 to a mission onboard Salyut-7, replacing Soyuz-T10 as the attached spacecraft.
