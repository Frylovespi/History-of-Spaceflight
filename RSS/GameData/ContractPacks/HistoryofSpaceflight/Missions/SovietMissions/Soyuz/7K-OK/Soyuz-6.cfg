    description = Soyuz 6 (Russian: Union 6) was the first of three manned Soyuz capsules to be launched shortly after each other, with the intention of performing a three capsule rendezvous, including a docking of two of the capsules. The main role of Soyuz 6 in this mission was to record the docking with TV cameras, however failure of rendezvous electronics in all three craft due to a new helium pressurization integrity test prevented the close range rendezvous and docking procedures. It was piloted by cosmonaut G. Shonin, Commander, and cosmonaut V. Kubasov, Flight Engineer. &br;&br;An additional objective was testing alternate methods for welding using remote handling equipment in the high vacuum and weightless conditions of outer space. In Soyuz 6, the welding unit had the name Vulcan and was controlled remotely by electric cable. Of the three types of welding tried (low pressure compressed arc, electron beam, and arc with a consumable electrode), electron beam was the most successful. Soyuz 6 did perform a group flight with Soyuz 7 and Soyuz 8, but it did not dock with either spacecraft. Soyuz 6 landed back on Earth on October 16, 1969, after nearly 5 days in orbit.
	
    notes = Launch Soyuz-6 into a parking orbit, to prepare for rendezvous with both Soyuz-7 and Soyuz-8. Leave it active in orbit until both companion missions are complete!
