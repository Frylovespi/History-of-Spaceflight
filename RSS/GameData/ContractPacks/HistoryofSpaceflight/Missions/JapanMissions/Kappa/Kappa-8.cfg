	description = The Kappa series represented Japan's first large post-war indigenously-developed sounding rockets. They led eventually to the Lambda and Mu solid rocket satellite launchers. Kappa-8 was a Two stage vehicle consisting of 1-K420 (34.0 kN) second stage SRB and 1 x Kappa-8 (110.0 kN) first stage SRB. It had a height of 6.0 m, a diameter of 0.33 m, a mass of 1500 kg, and could carry a payload of 60 kg to an altitude of 200 km. On the first test the Kappa-8 only reached an altitude 20 km before suffering a guidance loss. Kappa-8 was first launched on March 28, 1960, at the Akita Rocket Range.
