    description = The Cajun research rocket was developed as a dimensionally-similar but higher performance successor to the Deacon. In 1956, studies at PARD indicated that the Deacon's performance could be substantially improved by substituting new propellants while still retaining the Deacon's convenient configuration and size. NACA contracted with Thiokol Chemical Corp for the development and construction of this new motor. A total of 14 Cajun rockets were launched until their retirement in 1968. It had a thrust of 36.0 kN, a mass of 76.0 kg, a height of 2.60 m, a diameter of 0.17 m, and max altitude of 60 km.
