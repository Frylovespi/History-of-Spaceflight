    description = The Aggregat-5 was a scaled-down test model of the A-4 which replaced the former unsuccessful A-3 in this role. It was flown from 1938 to 1942, and played a vital role in testing the aerodynamics and technology of the A-4. Its rocket engine was identical to the A-3, with a new control system and a shape similar to the A-4. 25 were launched, some several times. It was fitted with a parachute recovery system and could float for up to two hours before sinking to allow recovery by boat.&br;&br;The A-5 was 5.825m in length with a diameter of 0.78m, had a mass of 900 kg, and like the A-3 was fueled with alcohol with liquid oxygen, which provided 14.71 kN of thrust for 45s of burn time. The max apogee of the A-5 was 12 km.
