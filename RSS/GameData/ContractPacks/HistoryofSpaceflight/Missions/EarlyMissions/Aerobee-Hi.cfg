    description = The Aerobee-Hi missile was an American sounding rocket. Aerobee Hi was a development of the basic Aerobee with longer propellant tanks, improved materials, a better propellant fraction, and smaller fins. The booster stage fired for 2.5 seconds and took the rocket to 270 m altitude and 820 kph. The upper stage then fired for 25 seconds, burning out at 40 km altitude traveling at 6400 kph. Thereafter, the payload would coast up to 270 km altitude before falling back toward earth. The first stage 2.5KS18000 produced 80.0 kN of thrust for 2.50 seconds, and the second stage AJ11-6 produced 17.80 kN of thrust for 25 seconds. It had a mass of 930 kg, a height of 9.3 m, a diameter of 0.39 m, and a max altitude of 270 km.
		 
	notes = Aerobee Hi was first flown on April 21, 1953 at the White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico.
