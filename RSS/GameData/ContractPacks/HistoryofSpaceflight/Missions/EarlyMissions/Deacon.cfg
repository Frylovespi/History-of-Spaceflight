    description = The Deacon solid rocket motor developed in World War II which later became the basis of dozens of test vehicle and sounding rocket configurations. The design was upgraded to the Cajun, then the Apache. An equivalent was produced by Atlantic Research as the Arcon. Thousands were flown as single stage vehicles; in combination with other lower or upper stages; or carried aloft by balloons in the Rockoon configuration. In total 95 Deacons were launched before their retirement in August 1958. The Deacon had a payload of 17.00 kg, a thrust of 27.00 kN, a height of 3.28 m, a diameter of 0.16 m, a mass of 93 kg, and a max altitude of 20 km.
		 
	notes = The first Deacon flew in April 1947. It was launched from the Wallops Island launch site.
