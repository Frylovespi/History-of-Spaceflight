	description = The Nike-Ajax was an American surface-to-air missile. It was a two stage vehicle consisting of the first stage Nike M5E1, and Ajax 21AL-2600 second stage. The US Army began development of the Nike Ajax after World War II. Upon entering service in 1954, it became the world's first operational surface-to-air missile. Western Electric was prime contractor for the complex overall system of radars, computers, guidance systems, launchers, and missiles, with Douglas the subcontractor for the missile. First unguided launches began in 1946. The missile had a solid rocket motor booster, with the second stage powered by a Bell liquid-propellant rocket engine. Four nose fins controlled the missile in flight. The first successful intercept of a B-17 target drone took place in November 1951. The first of 200 operational Nike sites equipped with 16,000 missiles was activated in 1954. There were 1087 Nike-Ajax launches before their retirement in 1958. The first stage M5E1 produced 217.0 kN of thrust for 3.40 seconds, and the second stage 21AL-2600 sustainer engine produced 11.60 kN of thrust for 71 seconds. It had a payload of 140.00 kg, a height of 10.82 m, a diameter of 0.30 m, a mass of 1040 kg, and a max altitude of 20 km. It had a maximum operational range of 40.0 kilometers, and reached a top speed in flight of 2,260 km/h (1,400 mph).
