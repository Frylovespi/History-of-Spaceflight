    description = The Army Hermes A-1 single stage test rocket was an American version of the German Wasserfall anti-aircraft rocket. Development began in 1946 of an American version of the German Wasserfall rocket. Problems with the rocket engine delayed the first (failed) launch to May. Another failure in September 1950 was followed by a success on 2 February 1951. After two more tests in March and April the program was terminated in 1951, having been rendered irrelevant by more successful development of the Nike Ajax surface-to-air missile. It had a thrust of 71.0 kN, a height of 7.7 m, a diameter of 0.86 m, a mass of 3,065 kg and a max altitude of 25 km. It had a max operation range of 65 km.
