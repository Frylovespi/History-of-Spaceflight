	description = Veronique was a French liquid-fueled sounding rocket that was partly developed by German scientists who had worked in Peenemuende. A successor to the canceled Super V-2, the Veronique was built between 1950 and 1969 in several versions, of which the versions P2, P6 and R were only experimental models. They were made in Vernon, Eure. The name Veronique is an abbreviation of Vernon-electronique It was a single stage liquid fueled missile that that used turpentine as it's main fuel source. There were 54 Veronique's launched before their retirement in 1965. It had a payload of 40.00 kg, a mass of 1300 kg, a thrust of 40.00 kN for 45 seconds, a height of 7.30 m, a diameter of 0.55 m, and an apogee of 100 km.
