    description = The Jupiter-C was an American three stage research and development vehicle developed from the Jupiter-A. Jupiter-C was used for three sub-orbital spaceflights in 1956 and 1957 to test re-entry nosecones that were later to be deployed on the more advanced PGM-19 Jupiter mobile missile. A member of the Redstone rocket family, Jupiter-C was designed by the U.S. Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA), under the direction of Wernher von Braun. There were three Jupiter-C flights before it was modified with the addition of the fourth stage, which consisted of a single sergeant rocket. This modified Jupiter-C, with the added fourth stage, became known as Juno-I and was used to orbit the first U.S satellite.
