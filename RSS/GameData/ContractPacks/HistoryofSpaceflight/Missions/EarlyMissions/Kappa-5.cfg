    description = The Kappa series represented Japan's first large post-war indigenously-developed sounding rockets. They led eventually to the Lambda and Mu solid rocket satellite launchers. Kappa-5 was a single stage vehicle consisting of single Kappa 5-1 engine. It produced a thrust of 34.00 kN for 9.30 seconds. It had a mass of 350 kg, a height of 5.90 m, a diameter of 0.33 m, and an apogee of 80 km.
