    description = The Kappa series represented Japan's first large post-war indigenously-developed sounding rockets. They led eventually to the Lambda and Mu solid rocket satellite launchers. Kappa-3 was Japan's first two stage sounding rocket. It consisted of a Kappa 3 first stage booster and a Kappa 1 second stage. It had a height of 5.00 m, a mass of 200 kg, a diameter of 0.22 m, and an apogee of 40 km.

	notes = Launch the Kappa-3 sounding rocket to 30 km altitude and recover the core intact.
