	description = The Kappa series represented Japan's first large post-war indigenously-developed sounding rockets. They led eventually to the Lambda and Mu solid rocket satellite launchers. The Kappa 7 was one of Japan's early sounding rockets and was designed as a booster for Japan's later Kappa 8 and Kappa 9 rockets. It was determined, however, that the vehicle was unsuitable as a single stage rocket. Kappa-7 was a single stage vehicle consisting of 1 x Kappa 7 solid rocket booster. It had a thrust of 100.00 kN, a height of 8.7 m, a diameter of 0.42 m, a mass of 1200 kg, and could reach an altitude of 50 km. 
 
	notes = Launch the Kappa 7 sounding rocket to 50 km altitude.
	synopsis = Kappa 7 was launched on November 18, 1959, at the Akita Rocket Range in Japan.
