	description = Soon after the success of Kappa-8, the Tokyo team developed its first three-stage rocket, the Kappa-9L. It consisted of 1-K150 (19.0 kN, 0.15 m diameter) third stage SRB, 1-K250-6 (34.0 kN, 0.25 m diameter) second stage SRB, and 1-K420 (110.0 kN, 0.42 m diameter) first stage SRB. It had a height of 11.6 m, a mass of 1600 kg, and could carry a payload of 25 kg to an altitude of 350 km.
