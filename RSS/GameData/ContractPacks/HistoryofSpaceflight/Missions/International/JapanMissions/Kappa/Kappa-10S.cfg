	description = Although there was only one launch of the Kappa-10S, it is worth mentioning as it achieved the highest apogee by far of the Kappa series. The three-stage 10S was a significant step on the way to a Japanese orbital capability, as it tested the apogee motor technology to be used in Japan’s first satellite launch vehicle, the Lambda 4S. The third stage spherical motor was a scaled-down version of the orbital vehicle’s fourth stage. In addition to the motor, the rocket carried an electron temperature probe. It consisted of 1-K10S (20 kn, 0.30 m diameter) third stage SRB,  1-K420(1/3) (45.0 kN, 0.42 m diameter) second stage SRB, and 1-K420H (110.0 kN, 0.42 m diameter) first stage SRB. Kappa 10S had a mass of 1520 kg, a maximum payload of 60 kg, and could reach an altitude of 350 km.
