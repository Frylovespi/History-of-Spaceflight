	description = The Lambda 4S or L-4S was an experimental Japanese expendable carrier rocket. It was produced by Nissan and the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science and launched five times between 1966 and 1970 with Ohsumi technology demonstration satellites. The first four launches failed, however the fifth, launched on 11 February 1970, successfully placed Ohsumi-5, the first Japanese satellite, into orbit. The Lambda 4S-3 fourth stage failed to ignite and the payload did not reach orbit. Ohsumi-3 had a mass of 26.0 kg.
