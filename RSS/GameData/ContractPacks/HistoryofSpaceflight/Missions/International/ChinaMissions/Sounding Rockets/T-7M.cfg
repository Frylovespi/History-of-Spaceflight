	description = In 1959, the Shanghai Institute of Machine and Electricity Design began to develop a sounding rocket called the T-5. Designed to study the atmosphere and its geophysical phenomena, the T-5 was built and assembled, but were unable to acquire the materials to build an engine test bed, and failed to obtain liquid oxygen. Instead in October 1959, the proceeded to design a smaller, less expensive rocket to investigate the atmosphere, the T-7. The T-7M was the development version of the T-7. It was a two stage sounding rocket with a low thrust solid first stage combined with a low thrust liquid fuelled upper stage.&br;&br;The T-7M had a height of 5.30 m, a diameter of 0.45 m, and a mass of 200 kg. It had a maximum altitude of 75 km.
   
    notes = Launch the T-7M sounding rocket to an altitude of 75 km and recover the experiment package.
