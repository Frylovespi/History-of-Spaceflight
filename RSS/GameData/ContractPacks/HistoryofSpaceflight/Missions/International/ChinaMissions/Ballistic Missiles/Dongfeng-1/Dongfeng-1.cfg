	description = The first missile produced for China's space program was the Dong Feng 1 missile (DF-1). It was a licensed copy of the Soviet R-2 (SS-2 Sibling) short-range ballistic missile, which is a direct descendant of the German V-2. The Soviet Union offered crucial help to jump start the ballistic missile program. Two R-1 (SS-1) rockets built by Korolev's design bureau were provided to China in 1956. More advanced R-2 (SS-2) missiles reached the country in December 1957.&br;&br;The missiles were followed by extensive engineering documentation and equipment and a large number of Soviet specialists arriving to organize production of the R-2 in China. Simultaneously, 50 Chinese students were sent to study missile technology in a leading Soviet educational engineering institution, the Moscow Aviation Institute.&br;&br:The DF-1 had a single 5D62 rocket engine, and used alcohol for fuel with liquid oxygen (LOX) as an oxidizer. It carried a 500 kg payload to a maximum range of 590 km.
