	description = In 1959, the Shanghai Institute of Machine and Electricity Design began to develop a sounding rocket called the T-5. Designed to study the atmosphere and its geophysical phenomena, the T-5 was built and assembled, but were unable to acquire the materials to build an engine test bed, and failed to obtain liquid oxygen. Instead in October 1959, the proceeded to design a smaller, less expensive rocket to investigate the atmosphere, the T-7. The T-7M was the development version of the T-7. It was a two stage sounding rocket with a low thrust solid first stage combined with a low thrust liquid fueled upper stage. The T-7M had a height of 5.30 m, a diameter of 0.45 m, and a mass of 200 kg. It had a maximum altitude of 10 km. The T-7M was first launched on February 19, 1960, at the Laogang Sounding Rocket launch site in Shanghai, China.
