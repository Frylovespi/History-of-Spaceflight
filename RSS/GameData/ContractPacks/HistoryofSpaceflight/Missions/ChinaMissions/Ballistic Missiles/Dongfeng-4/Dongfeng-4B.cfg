	description = The Dong Feng 4 (DF-4) is a two-stage, inter-continental ballistic missile (ICBM) with a range of 4,750 km. The DF-4 employs a DF-3 launcher with an added stage to help power the single 3 MT warhead to inter-continental ranges. Development of the DF-4 began in 1965 and China began testing in the early 1970s, reaching an initial operational capability (IOC) in the 1980. It is estimated however, that only four DF-4s were deployed by 1984. The DF-4 was not heavily deployed and only about 30 missiles were ever constructed. As of 2009, China still deploys about 20 DF-4 missiles as part of its nuclear arsenal, although these missiles are slowly being replaced by the DF-21 missile. The DF-3 had a maximum range of 4,750 km and carried a 2,200kg payload.
