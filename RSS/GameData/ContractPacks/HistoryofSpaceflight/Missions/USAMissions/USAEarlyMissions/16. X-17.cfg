	description = The X-17 missile was an American sounding rocket. The USAF X-17 flight test program at Cape Canaveral studied reentry problems by simulating reentry velocities and conditions with a three-stage solid-fuel Lockheed X-17. A total of 26 X-17 flights were conducted until March 1957.&br;&br;The X-17 had a mass of 3,400 kg, a thrust of 220.0 kN, a height of 12.3 m, a diameter of 0.79 m, and a max altitude of 500 km.
