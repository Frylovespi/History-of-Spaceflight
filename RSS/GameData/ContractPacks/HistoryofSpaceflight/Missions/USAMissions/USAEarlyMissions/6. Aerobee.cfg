    description = The Aerobee sounding rockets were derived from the Aerojet Wac Corporal and the Bumblebee missile developed under a US Navy program. This combination of an Aerojet booster and a Bumblebee second stage was dubbed the Aerobee. Aerobees were launched from 53 m tall launch towers to provide the necessary stability until enough speed had been gained for the fins to be effective in controlling the rocket. Launch towers were built at White Sands, Fort Churchill, Wallops Island, and aboard the research ship USN Norton Sound. More than a thousand Aerobees were launched in total, with a 97,8% success rate. br;&br;The first stage 2.5KS18000 produced 80.0 kN of thrust for 2.50 seconds, and the second stage AJ11-6 produced 17.80 kN of thrust for 12 seconds. The Aerobee had a mass of 727 kg, and could carry a payload of 68.00 kg. It had a height of 7.80 m, a diameter of 0.38 m, and an max altitude of 130 km.
