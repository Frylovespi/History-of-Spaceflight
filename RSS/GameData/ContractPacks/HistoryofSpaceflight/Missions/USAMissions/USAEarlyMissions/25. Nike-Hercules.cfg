	description = Nike-Hercules was an American two stage surface-to-air missile, replaced Nike Ajax, operational with the US and allied armies. Rocket stages later used in sounding rockets. Vehicle consisting of a Hercules first stage, and a TX-30 Draco second stge. A solid-propellant second stage replaced the dangerous and troublesome liquid propellant stage of the Nike Ajax. Since Nike Hercules used the same guidance and ground components, many Nike Ajax missiles were replaced by Nike Hercules at the existing sites in 1958-1963. Nike Hercules were normally fitted with a blast-fragmentation warhead, but some received the variable yield (2 kT-40 kT) W-31 nuclear warhead. A total of 154 Nike-Hercules were launched until their retirement in 1971.&br;&br;The first stage Hercules M42 engine produced 772.0 kN of thrust for 3.40 seconds, and the second stage TX-30 Draco produced 44.50 kN of thrust for 29 seconds.  Nike Hercules had a height of 11.90 m, a diameter of 1.06 m, a mass of 4,900 kg, and could reach a max altitude of 45 km.
