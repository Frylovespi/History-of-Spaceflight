	description = The MGM-29-Sergeant was an American single-stage solid-propulsion tactical ballistic missile developed for the US Army in 1956-1962. Surplus rockets and the Sergeant's rocket motor (known commercially as Castor) became the basis for many sounding rockets, test vehicles, stages for orbital launch vehicles, and lateral boosters for the Delta space launch vehicle. There were a total of 148 MGM-29-Sergeant launches before its retirement in 1994. The W52 200 KT warhead was chosen for use on the Sergeant.&br;&br;The Thiokol solid fuel XM100 (Castor) engine produced a thrust of 200.0 kN for 34 seconds. It had a height of 10.52 m, a diameter of 0.79 m, a mass of 4570 kg, and could carry a 820 kg warhead to a downrange distance of 139 km.
