	description = The Apollo-Saturn 203 (AS-203) mission was an unmanned suborbital flight to test the Saturn 1B launch vehicle and the Apollo Command and Service Modules. The objectives of the flight were to verify the structural integrity, launch loads, stage separation, and operation of subsystems of the Saturn 1B, and evaluate the Apollo spacecraft separations, emergency detection system, subsystems, heatshield at high re-entry velocity, and mission support facilities. It successfully achieved its objectives, but the stage was inadvertently destroyed after four orbits.

	notes = Launch the Saturn 1B test rocket into low Earth orbit and destroy the vessel after 6 hours in orbit.
