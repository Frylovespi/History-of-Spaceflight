	description =  Atlas Centaur 3 (AC-3) was launched on June 30, 1964. Atlas performance was nominal other than slightly improper operation of propellant utilization system for the first minute of flight that resulted in LOX-rich engine operation. Insulation panel and payload shroud jettison were tested for the first time. Following Centaur staging and engine start, the C-2 engine began to lose roll control. The C-1 engine was able to compensate for a time, but the Centaur eventually lost control and began tumbling. Premature engine shutdown due to propellant starvation occurred at T+496 seconds and the Centaur impacted in the South Atlantic. Post flight investigation traced the malfunction to a failure of the C-2 engine hydraulic gimbal actuator.
