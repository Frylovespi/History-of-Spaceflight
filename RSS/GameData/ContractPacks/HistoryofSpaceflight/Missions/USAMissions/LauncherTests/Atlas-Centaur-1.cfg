	description =  Atlas Centaur 1 (AC-1) was the first test of an Atlas Centaur launch vehicle. Vehicle F-1 (Atlas 104D and Centaur F-1), arrived at Cape Canaveral in October 1961 and was erected at the newly completed LC-36A, a pad built specifically for A/C flights. Flight plans amounted to little more than a single burn with a partially fuelled Centaur, just to verify that the launch vehicle combination would actually fly. However, technical problems and other delays caused it to sit there for seven months, the most serious being leakage of liquid hydrogen through the intermediate bulkhead separating the propellant tanks, and numerous lesser maladies with the guidance and propulsion systems. The mission at last got under way on May 8, 1962. All went well until about T+53 seconds when the Centaur stage ruptured and disintegrated, taking the Atlas with it in a matter of seconds.
