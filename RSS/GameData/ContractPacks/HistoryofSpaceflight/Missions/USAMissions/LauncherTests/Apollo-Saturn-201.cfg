	description = The Apollo-Saturn 201 (AS-201) mission was an unmanned suborbital flight to test the Saturn 1B launch vehicle and the Apollo Command and Service Modules. It was the first flight of the two-stage Saturn 1B. The objectives of the flight were to verify the structural integrity, launch loads, stage separation, and operation of subsystems of the Saturn 1B, and evaluate the Apollo spacecraft subsystems, heatshield, and mission support facilities. Due to loss of data during maximum heating of the heatshield the evaluation of the ablator at high re-entry rates was not achieved, but all other objectives were met.

	notes = Launch the AS-201 Saturn 1B test rocket to 450 km altitude on a sub-orbital flight and recover the command module intact.
