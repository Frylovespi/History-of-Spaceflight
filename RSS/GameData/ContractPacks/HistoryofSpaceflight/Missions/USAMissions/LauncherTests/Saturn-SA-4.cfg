	description = This was an uncrewed test flight of the Saturn I (SA-4) booster and the final of a series of four tests of the Saturn first stage. The rocket was launched on a sub-orbital flight to an altitude of 129 km and a peak velocity of 5906 km/hr. After 100 seconds of flight, a pre-set timer cut off engine no. 5 as planned to test the "engine-out" capability of the booster. Fuel was successfully routed to the other seven engines and the flight continued. This completed the Block 1 Saturn tests.
