	description = This Atlas Centaur 2 launch vehicle was used for a performance and structural integrity test. It was instrumented with 2000 pounds of sensors, equipment, and telemetry. It performed the world’s first successful flight of a hydrogen-oxygen rocket. The booster performed perfectly and the Centaur second stage ignited its liquid-hydrogen engines in space and went into orbit as the heaviest object (4,750 kg) yet orbited by the U.S. Although another six flights remained before the Centaur could be considered operational, this first successful flight of the high-energy liquid hydrogen/liquid oxygen booster was a major landmark in a development program dogged with delays and disappointment.
