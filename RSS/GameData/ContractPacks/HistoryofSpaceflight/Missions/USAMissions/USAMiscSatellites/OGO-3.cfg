	description = The OGO 3 spacecraft was the third of a series of six Orbiting Geophysical Observatories. Its purpose was to conduct many diversified geophysical experiments to obtain a better understanding of the earth as a planet. OGO 3 consisted of a main body that was parallelepipedal in form, two solar panels, each with a solar-oriented experiment package (SOEP), and two orbital plane experiment packages (OPEP), and six appendages EP-1 through EP-6 supporting the boom experiment packages. It had a mass of 514.8 kg. Due to a failure in the attitude control subsystem on 23 July 1966, the spacecraft was put into a permanent spin mode about the Z axis. OGO 3 was still able to conduct experiments and transmit data. A total of 21 experiments were carried out, 13 of which were particle physics experiments.
