	description = The US Army's SCORE (Signal Communication by Orbiting RElay) satellite. The Atlas missile was used as a platform for the communications relay experiment package. The missiles body served as antennae. This satellite was to demonstrate the feasibility of, and explore problems associated with, the operation of a satellite communications system. It carried messages on a tape recorder which was used at one point to carry a Christmas greeting from President Eisenhower. The performance was nominal with experiment operation for 12 days. It had a planned orbit lifetime of 20 days, its actual orbit lifetime was 35 days. The tracking beacon operated at 108 MHz.
