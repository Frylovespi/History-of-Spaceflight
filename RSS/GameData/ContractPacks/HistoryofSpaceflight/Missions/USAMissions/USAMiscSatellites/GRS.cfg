	description = GRS (Geophysical Research Satellite) was a geophysics experiment test built by the Cambridge Research Lab (CRL). Data was obtained for 13 orbits, after which time the satellite ceased working due to a failure in the primary power supply. It carried three experiments: A magnetic mass spectrometer was flown to measure the distributions of the ion species in the topside ionosphere between 420 and 1200 km. All species having mass-to-charge ratios from 1 to 32 could be measured. A Retarding Potential Analyzer instrumentation for this experiment included a retarding potential analyzer that, through proper sequencing of appropriate voltages, was sensitive to photoelectrons having energies of up to 60 eV, positive ions of up to 30 eV. Personal Hazards Associated with Space Radiation It had a mass of 99.0 kg.
