	title = Transtage 2

	description = Transtage was developed in anticipation of a requirement to launch military payloads to geostationary orbit; a contract for development of the stage was issued on 20 August 1962. Transtage used a pressure-fed two-chamber configuration, using Aerozine 50 fuel and nitrogen tetroxide as oxidizer; the thrust chambers were gimbaled for steering and each produced 8,000-pound-force (36,000 N) of thrust. The design requirement called for the capability for up to three restarts during the first six hours of a mission. It had a mass of 1700.0 kg.
