	description = Mariner 10 was the first mission to use the gravitational attraction of one planet to reach another, the first mission with two planetary objectives, and (to date) the only mission ever to perform up close imaging and science at Mercury. The spacecraft flew by Mercury three times in a retrograde heliocentric orbit and returned images and data on the planet. The primary scientific objectives of the mission were to measure Mercury's environment, atmosphere, surface, and body characteristics and to make similar investigations of Venus. Secondary objectives were to perform experiments in the interplanetary medium and to obtain experience with a dual-planet gravity-assist mission.&br;&br;After launch, Mariner 10 was placed in orbit around the Sun en route to Venus. The orbit direction was opposite to the motion of the Earth around the Sun. Mid-course corrections were made. Several systems and experiments experienced problems on the way to Venus, limiting the spacecraft's capabilities. The spacecraft passed Venus on 5 February 1974, at a closest range of 5768 km and returned close-up images of Venus. Mariner 10 crossed the orbit of Mercury on 29 March 1974, at a distance of about 704 km from the surface. A second encounter with Mercury, when more photographs were taken, occurred on 21 September 1974, at an altitude of 48,069 km. Unfortunately the lighted hemisphere was almost the same as the first encounter, so a large portion of the planet remained unimaged. A third and last Mercury encounter at an altitude of 327 km, with additional photography of about 300 frames and magnetic field measurements occurred on 16 March 1975.
