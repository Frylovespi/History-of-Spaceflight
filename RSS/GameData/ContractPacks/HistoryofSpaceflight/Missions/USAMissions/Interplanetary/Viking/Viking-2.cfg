	description = The Viking 2 mission was part of the American Viking program to Mars, and consisted of an orbiter and a lander essentially identical to that of the Viking 1 mission.[1] The craft was launched on September 9, 1975, 20 days after Viking 1. Viking 2 was operational on Mars for 1281 sols (1316 days; 3 years, 221 days). The Viking 2 lander operated on the surface for 1316 days, or 1281 sols, and was turned off on April 12, 1980, when its batteries failed. The orbiter worked until July 25, 1978,[1] returning almost 16,000 images in 706 orbits around Mars. The Viking 2 lander touched down about 200 km west of the crater Mie in Utopia Planitia at 48.269°N 225.990°W.

	notes = Launch the Viking 2 spacecraft and achieve intact landing on solid ground on @/targetBody, transmitting data from its surface.
