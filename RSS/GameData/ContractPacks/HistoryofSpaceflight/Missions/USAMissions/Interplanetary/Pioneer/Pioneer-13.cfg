	description = Pioneer 13, also known as Pioneer Venus Multiprobe, consisted of a bus which carried one large and three small atmospheric probes. The large probe was released on 16 November 1978 and the three small probes on November 20. All four probes entered the Venus atmosphere on December 9, followed by the bus. The four probes all caried instrumentation to study the atmosphere. &br;&br;The Pioneer Venus large probe was equipped with 7 science experiments, contained within a sealed spherical pressure vessel. This pressure vessel was encased in a nose cone and aft protective cover. After deceleration from initial atmospheric entry at about 11.5 km/s near the equator on the Venus night side, a parachute was deployed at 47 km altitude.&br;&br;The three small probes were identical to each other, 0.8 m in diameter. These probes also consisted of spherical pressure vessels surrounded by an aeroshell, but unlike the large probe, they had no parachutes and the aeroshells did not separate from the probe. The radio signals from all four probes were used to characterize the winds, turbulence, and propogation in the atmosphere. The small probes were each targeted at different parts of the planet and were named accordingly.
