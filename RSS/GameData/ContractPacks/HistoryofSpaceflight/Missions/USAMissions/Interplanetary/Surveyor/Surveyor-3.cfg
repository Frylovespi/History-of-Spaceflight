	description = Surveyor 3 was the third lander of the American unmanned Surveyor program sent to explore the surface of the Moon and the second spacecraft of the Surveyor series to achieve a lunar soft landing. Launched on April 17, 1967, Surveyor 3 landed on April 20, 1967, at the Mare Cognitum portion of the Oceanus Procellarum (S3 01' 41.43" W23 27' 29.55"). The spacecraft bounced twice on landing due to a late cut off of the landing engines.&br;&br;This Surveyor mission was the first one that carried a surface-soil sampling-scoop, which can be seen on its extendable arm in the pictures. This mechanism was mounted on an electric-motor-driven arm and was used to dig four trenches in the lunar soil. These trenches were up to 18 centimeters deep. Samples of soil from the trenches were placed in front of the Surveyor's television cameras to be photographed and the pictures radioed back to the Earth. When the first lunar nightfall came on May 3, 1967, it was shut down because its solar panels were no longer producing electricity. At the next lunar dawn (after 14 terrestrial days, or about 336 hours), Surveyor 3 could not be reactivated. It transmitted 6,300 still images.&br;Surveyor 3 was visited by the crew of Apollo 12, which landed with the Lunar Module 'Intrepid' nearby. Some parts of the probe, including the TV camera, were returned to Earth.
