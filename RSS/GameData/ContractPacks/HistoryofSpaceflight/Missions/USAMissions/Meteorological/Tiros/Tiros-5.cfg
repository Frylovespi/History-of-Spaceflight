	description = The TIROS Program (Television Infrared Observation Satellite) was NASA's first experimental step to determine if satellites could be useful in the study of the Earth. Tiros-5 was equipped with two 1.27-cm vidicon TV cameras, one medium angle and one wide angle, for taking earth cloudcover pictures. The pictures were transmitted directly to either of two ground receiving stations or were stored in a tape recorder on board for subsequent playback depending on whether the satellite was within or beyond the communication range of the station.

	notes = Launch the TIROS 5 meteorological satellite into orbit.
	synopsis = TIROS 5 was launched from a Thor-Delta rocket from the Cape Canaveral launch site on June 19, 1962.
