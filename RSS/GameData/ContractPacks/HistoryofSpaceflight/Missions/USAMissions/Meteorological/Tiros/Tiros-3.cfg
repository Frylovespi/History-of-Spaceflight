    description = The TIROS Program (Television Infrared Observation Satellite) was NASA's first experimental step to determine if satellites could be useful in the study of the Earth. TIROS 3 was equipped with two independent television camera subsystems for taking cloudcover pictures, plus a two-channel low-resolution radiometer, an omni-directional radiometer, and a five-channel infrared scanning radiometer. Tiros 3 had a mass of 127 kg.
