	description = The TIROS Program (Television Infrared Observation Satellite) was NASA's first experimental step to determine if satellites could be useful in the study of the Earth. TIROS 4 was equipped with two independent television camera subsystems for taking cloud cover pictures and three radiometers (two-channel low-resolution, omni-directional, and five-channel scanning) for measuring radiation from the earth and its atmosphere.&br;&br;TIROS 4 was placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 840 km, a perigee of 712 km, an inclination of 48.3 degrees, and an orbital period of 100 minutes. The mission ended with the loss of contact with the spacecraft on June 30, 1962.
