	description = The Nimbus satellites were second-generation U.S. robotic spacecraft used for meteorological research and development. The spacecraft were designed to serve as stabilized, Earth-oriented platforms for the testing of advanced systems to sense and collect atmospheric science data. Nimbus 4 was nearly 3.7 m tall, 1.45 m in diameter at the base, and about 3 m across with solar paddles extended. The torus-shaped sensor mount, which formed the satellite base, housed the electronics equipment and battery modules. The lower surface of the torus ring provided mounting space for sensors and telemetry antennas. An H-frame structure mounted within the center of the torus provided support for the larger experiments and tape recorders. Mounted on the control system housing, which was on top of the spacecraft, were sun sensors, horizon scanners, gas nozzles for attitude control, and a command antenna. The spacecraft performed well until 14 April 1971, when attitude problems started. The experiments operated on a limited time basis after that time until 30 September 1980.
