         description = ESSA 4 was a sun-synchronous operational meteorological satellite designed to provide real-time earth cloudcover TV pictures to properly equipped ground receiving stations for use in weather analysis and forecasting. The satellite had essentially the same configuration as that of the TIROS spacecraft, i.e., an 18-sided right prism, 107 cm across opposite corners and 56 cm high, with a reinforced baseplate carrying most of the subsystems and a cover assembly (hat). Electrical power was provided by approximately 10,000 1- by 2-cm solar cells that were mounted on the cover assembly and by 21 nickel-cadmium batteries. Two redundant wide-angle Automatic Picture Transmission (APT) cameras were mounted on opposite sides of the spacecraft with their optical axes perpendicular to the spin axis. Projecting downward from the baseplate were a pair of crossed-dipole command reception antennas. It had a mass of 285.0 kg and was launched from a Thor-Delta D rocket from the Cape Canaveral launch site on November 10, 1967.
