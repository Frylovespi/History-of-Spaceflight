	description = Originally part of a classified system of USAF weather satellites, the spacecraft's missions were not revealed until March 1973. The cylindrically shaped Block 4 satellites incorporated two new one-inch diameter vidicon cameras, video (2), a large capacity tape recorder, and an all-digital command subsystem with magnetic core memory, giving fully programmable coverage of either direct readout or readout of recorded data without interference. Nominal satellite spin rate was decreased to reduce smear, permitting a higher resolution TV system for improved picture quality. Dual cameras and a high capacity recorder provided complete daily coverage of the entire northern hemisphere and tactical coverage anywhere on the earth. It had a mass of 150.0 kg.
