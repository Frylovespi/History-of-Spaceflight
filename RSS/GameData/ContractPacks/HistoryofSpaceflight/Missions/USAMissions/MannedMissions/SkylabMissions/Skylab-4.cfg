	description = Skylab 4 (also SL-4 and SLM-3) was the third manned Skylab mission and placed the third and final crew aboard the first American space station. The mission started on November 16, 1973 with the launch of three astronauts on a Saturn IB rocket from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida and lasted 84 days, one hour and 16 minutes. A total of 6,051 astronaut-utilization hours were tallied by Skylab 4 astronauts performing scientific experiments in the areas of medical activities, solar observations, Earth resources, observation of the Comet Kohoutek and other experiments.&br;&br;This final Skylab mission completed 1,214 Earth orbits and four EVAs totalling 22 hours, 13 minutes. It also increased the manned space flight time record by 50%. Rebellion by the crew against NASA Ground Control overtasking led to none of the crew ever flying again.
