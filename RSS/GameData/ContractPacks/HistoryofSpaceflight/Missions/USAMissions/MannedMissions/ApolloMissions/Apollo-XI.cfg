	description = Apollo 11 was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the Moon. On 20 July 1969 two astronauts (Apollo 11 Commander Neil A. Armstrong and LM pilot Edwin E. "Buzz" Aldrin Jr.) landed in Mare Tranquilitatis (the Sea of Tranquility) on the Moon in the Lunar Module (LM) while the Command and Service Module (CSM) (with CM pilot Michael Collins) continued in lunar orbit. During their stay on the Moon, the astronauts set up scientific experiments, took photographs, and collected lunar samples. The LM took off from the Moon on 21 July and the astronauts returned to Earth on 24 July.&br;&br;The mission profile was virtually identical to Apollo X, up until the point where the LM descended to the lunar surface from its low orbit. The LM lifted off from the Moon on 21 July after 21 hours, 36 minutes on the lunar surface. After docking with the CSM, the LM was jettisoned into lunar orbit on 22 July. Transearth injection began on 22 July and a mid-course correction was made later that day. The CM separated from the SM on 24 July. Apollo 11 splashed down in the Pacific Ocean after a mission elapsed time of 195 hours. The performance of the spacecraft was excellent throughout the mission.
