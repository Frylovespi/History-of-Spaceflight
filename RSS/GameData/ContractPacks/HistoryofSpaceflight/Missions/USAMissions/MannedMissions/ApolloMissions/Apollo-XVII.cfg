	description = Apollo 17 was the final mission of the United States' Apollo program, the enterprise that landed the first humans on the Moon. On 11 December 1972 two astronauts (Commander Eugene A. Cernan and LM pilot Harrison H. Schmitt, the first scientist on the Moon) landed in the Taurus-Littrow region of the Moon in the Lunar Module (LM) while the Command and Service Module (CSM) (with CM pilot Ronald E. Evans) continued in lunar orbit. During their stay on the Moon, the astronauts set up scientific experiments, took photographs, and collected lunar samples. The LM took off from the Moon on 14 December and the astronauts returned to Earth on 19 December.&br;&br;The LM landed on the southeastern rim of Mare Serenitatis in a valley at Taurus-Littrow. Cernan and Schmitt made three moonwalk extra-vehicular activities (EVAs) totaling 22 hours, 4 minutes. During this time they covered 30 km using the Lunar Roving Vehicle, collected 110.52 kg of lunar samples, took photographs, set up the ALSEP and performed other scientific experiments. Evans performed experiments from orbit in the CSM during this time. Like with previous Apollo missions, the LM was sent to impact the Moon after docking back with the CSM, it impacted approximately 15 km from the Apollo 17 landing site.&br;&br;Apollo 17 included a biological cosmic ray experiment (BIOCORE), carrying five mice that had been implanted with radiation monitors to see whether they suffered damage from cosmic rays. Apollo 17 splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on 19 December 1972 after a mission elapsed time of 301 hours.
