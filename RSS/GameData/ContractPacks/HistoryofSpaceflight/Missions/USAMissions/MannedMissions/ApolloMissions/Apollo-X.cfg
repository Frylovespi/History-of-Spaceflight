	description = Apollo 10 was the fourth manned mission in the United States Apollo space program. The mission was a full "dry run" for the Apollo 11 mission, in which all operations except the actual lunar landing were performed. The flight carried a three man crew: Commander Thomas P. Stafford, Command Module (CM) Pilot John W. Young, and Lunar Module (LM) Pilot Eugene A. Cernan. After launch on 18 May 1969, the spacecraft was inserted into a  parking orbit, followed by translunar injection. The CSM separated from the Saturn V 3rd stage (S-IVB), transposed, and docked with the LM. After a three day cruise, Apollo 10 entered an initial 315.5 km x 110.4 km lunar orbit on 21 May 1969, using a 356 sec. SPS burn. A second SPS burn lasting 19.3 seconds circularized the orbit to 113.9 km x 109.1 km.&br;&br;On 22 May Stafford and Cernan entered the LM and fired the SM reaction control thrusters to separate the LM from the CSM. The LM was put into an orbit to allow low altitude passes over the lunar surface, the closest approach bringing it to within 14 km of the Moon. All systems on the LM were tested during the separation including communications, propulsion, attitude control, and radar. Numerous close-up photographs of the Moon's surface, in particular the planned Apollo landing sites, were taken. The LM descent stage was jettisoned into lunar orbit, presumably to impact the lunar surface at an unknown location when its orbit naturally decayed sometime in 1969. The LM and CSM rendezvous and redocking occurred 8 hours after separation on 23 May.&br;&br;Later on May 23 the LM ascent stage was jettisoned into solar orbit, and on 24 May after 31 lunar orbits the CSM rockets fired for trans-earth injection. CM-SM separation took place on 26 May and Apollo 10 splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on 26 May 1969 after a mission elapsed time of 192 hrs.
