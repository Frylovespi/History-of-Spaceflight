	description = Gemini 10 was the eighth crewed Earth-orbiting spacecraft of the Gemini series, carrying astronauts John Young and Michael Collins. Its primary purpose was to conduct rendezvous and docking tests with the Agena target vehicle. Rendezvous with the Gemini X ATV was completed after four orbits. Docking duration was one day fourteen hours and fourty-five minutes. After 3 days in orbit Gemini X successfully returned to Earth with a splashdown off the coast of the Bahamas.

	notes = Launch John Young and Michael Collins in the Gemini X spacecraft into orbit, dock with the Gemini X ATV, and return home after 3 days in orbit.
