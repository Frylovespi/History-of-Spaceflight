	description = Gemini XII was the tenth and final flight of the Gemini series, which bridged the Mercury and Apollo programs. This mission, carrying astronauts Jim Lovell and Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin, was scheduled to perform rendezvous and docking with the Agena target vehicle, to conduct three ExtraVehicular Activity (EVA) operations, to conduct a tethered station keeping exercise, to perform docked maneuvers using the Agena propulsion system to change orbit, and demonstrate an automatic reentry. There were also 14 scientific, medical, and technological experiments on board. Rendezvous with the Gemini XII ATV was completed after three orbits. Docking duration was one day nineteen hours and fourty-five minutes.

	notes = Launch Jim Lovell and Buzz Aldrin in the Gemini XII capsule into orbit, dock with the Gemini XII ATV and return home after 4 days.
