	description = Gemini 11 was the ninth crewed Earth-orbiting spacecraft of the Gemini series, carrying astronauts Charles "Pete" Conrad and Richard Gordon. The 3-day mission was designed to achieve a first orbit rendezvous and docking with the Agena target vehicle, to accomplish two ExtraVehicular Activity (EVA) tests, to perform docking practice, docked configuration maneuvers, tethered operations, parking of the Agena target vehicle and demonstrate an automatic reentry. There were also eight scientific and four technological experiments on board. Rendezvous with the Gemini-XI-ATV was completed after one orbit. Docking duration was one day fourteen hours and fourty-five minutes.

	notes = Launch Pete Conrad and Richard Gordon in the Gemini XI capsule into orbit, dock with Gemini XI ATV, and return home after 3 days.
