	description = The objectives of the OSO satellite series were to perform solar physics experiments above the atmosphere during a complete solar cycle and to map the entire celestial sphere for direction and intensity of UV light and X-ray and gamma radiation. The OSO 2 platform consisted of a sail section, which pointed two experiments continuously toward the sun, and a wheel section, which spun about an axis perpendicular to the pointing direction of the sail and carried six experiments. The spacecraft performed normally until the pitch gas supply neared exhaustion on November 6, 1965. The spacecraft was then placed in a stowed condition. The transmitter was commanded on intermittently until March 3, 1966, and then on a weekly schedule until June 1, 1966, when it ceased operation. It had a mass of 547.7 kg.
