	description = Pegasus 1 or Pegasus I, known before launch as Pegasus A, was an American satellite which was launched in 1965 to study micrometeoroid impacts in Low Earth orbit. It was the second of three Pegasus satellites to be launched, following the launch of Pegasus 1 three months earlier. The Pegasus spacecraft were manufactured by Fairchild Hiller, and operated by NASA. Pegasus 2 was a Pegasus spacecraft, consisting of 1,450 kg of instruments, attached to the S-IV upper stage of the carrier rocket which had placed it into orbit. It was equipped with two sets of micrometeoroid detection panels, and a radio for tracking and returning data. The panels were 29 m long, and equipped with 116 individual detectors.&br;&br;Pegasus 1 was placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 731 km, a perigee of 500 km, an inclination of 31.7 degrees, and an orbital period of 97.0 minutes. The mission ended with the deactivation of the spacecraft on August 29, 1968. It decayed from orbit on September 17, 1978.
