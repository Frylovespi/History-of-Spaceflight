         description = The mission of this spacecraft was to measure meteoroid abundances over the mass range 1.E-7 to 1.E-4 g in the region near the earth. In its stored position with panels folded inside the Apollo service module, the spacecraft was 5.3-m high, 2.1-m wide, and 28-cm deep. It was divided into two major parts, the center section and the wing assemblies. The satellites' framework was made of riveted aluminum alloy extrusions. The central section was attached to the launch vehicle's second stage. It provided a mounting for the deployment mechanism, electronics cannister, solar power panels, and sensors. The spacecraft was equipped with winglike appendages that extended to form a plane 29.3-m long by 4.3-m wide. These wings carried sensitive penetration surfaces for the experiments. It had a mass of 1451.5 kg and was launched from a Saturn-1 rocket from the Cape Canaveral launch site on May 25, 1965.
