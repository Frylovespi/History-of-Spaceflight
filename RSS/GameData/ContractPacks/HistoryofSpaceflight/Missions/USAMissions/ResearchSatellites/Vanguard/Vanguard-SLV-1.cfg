	description = Vanguard Satellite Launch Vehicle 1 (SLV-1) hoped to be the second successful flight of the American Vanguard rocket following the successful Vanguard 1 satellite on rocket Vanguard TV-4. It was launched from Launch Complex 18A at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. At second stage separation, there was a momentary pitching motion registered by the rate gyros which resulted in an incorrect attitude reference. The second stage placed the third stage on a trajectory approximately 63° up from the intended flight path. It arced upward and reached a peak altitude of 2200 miles before reentering and breaking up over South Africa. The pitching motion was deemed to be a rupture in the second stage engine thrust chamber due to high frequency combustion instability at engine shutdown. On subsequent flights, the second stage was modified to prevent the possibility of an oxidizer-rich shutdown.
         
	notes = Launch the Vanguard-SLV-1 and suffer a failure in your second stage guidance system.
