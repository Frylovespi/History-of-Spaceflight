	description = The Vanguard Test Vehicle 3 Backup (TV-3 BU) failed less than one minute after launch on 5 February 1958. The satellite was, as the name implies, built as a backup to the Vanguard TV-3 satellite, which was launched unsuccessfully on 6 December 1957. The main purpose of the Vanguard Test Vehicle launchings was systems testing for the launch vehicle and satellite. The program objectives for the satellite were to conduct micrometeorite impact and geodetic measurements from Earth orbit. Engineering studies included electron charge and temperature of the satellite. The IGY Vanguard satellite program was designed with the purpose of launching one or more Earth orbiting satellites during the International Geophysical Year (IGY). The mission was a failure when the second stage failed to ignite.
