	description = Vela 1A and 1B were two spin-stabilized (2.1 rev/sec) 124-kg satellites comprising the first launch in a series of three Vela launches. The orbits of the two satellites on each launch were basically circular at about 17 earth radii and were spaced 180 deg apart. Their objectives were to monitor nuclear weapons explosions in space and to study x-rays, gamma-rays, neutrons, and charged particles as the satellites passed through interplanetary space, the bow shock, the magnetosheath, and the magnetotail. The satellite operated in either a real-time mode (one data frame/sec) or a memory store mode (one data frame every 256 sec). They each had a mass of 150.0 kg.&br;&br; Aboard this flight was the piggyback satellite ERS-12. The ERS satellites were spin-stabilized tetrahedrons that weighed 2.1 kg and measured 22.86 cm along each triangular edge. The spin rate was approximately 10 rpm, and power was obtained by solar cells. The satellite carried a scintillation counter and a solid-state detector to measure electrons and protons in the radiation belts.
