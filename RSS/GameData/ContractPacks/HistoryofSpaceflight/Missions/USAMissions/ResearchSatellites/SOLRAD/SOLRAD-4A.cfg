    description = The SOLRAD 4A spin-stabilized spacecraft was a sphere of 51 cm diameter. The spacecraft carried two Lyman-alpha photometers and one X-ray photometer mounted along the equator of the satellite. A visible light aspect system that used a vacuum photocell to determine the solar aspect angle was also attached. The objective of the project was to make long-term continuous observations of the solar hydrogen Lyman-alpha and soft X-ray emissions and to correlate these emissions with ground-based observations. The satellite was to be orbited along with ionospheric study satellite Lofti 2, the United States Army's range calibration satellite Secor, Navy surveillance calibration satellite Surcal, and the University of Iowa's Van Allen Belts studying INJUN 2 satellite. This unprecedented five-in-one mission was called "Composite 1" and "Buckshot."  The mission ended in failure when the second stage Ablestar failed to ignite.
