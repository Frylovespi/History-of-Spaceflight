	description = SOLRAD 6 (POPPY 4A) was a joint US Air Force, US Navy satellite launched along with five other piggyback satellites launched from the Western Test Range. SOLRAD 6 contained instruments to conduct solar radiation experiments. It had a mass of 39.0 kg. SOLRAD was the cover story for the POPPY ELINT program declassified in 2005.&br;&br;NRL-PL112 (POPPY 4B) was a classified first generation POPPY satellite launched piggyback that was the successor to the GRAB program of ELINT reconnaissance satellites. It used the same 51 cm diamter sphere as the GRAB satellites. POPPY 4B's mission was to collect radar emissions from Soviet air and missile defense radars.&br;&br;RADOSE(POPPY 4C, and Radiation Dosimeter) was a joint US Air Force, US Navy research satellite launched piggyback on the SOLRAD 6 flight. It took radiation dosimeter measurements.&br;&br;LOFTI 2A (Low Frequency Trans Ionospheric Satellite) was a 26.0 kg US military research satellite. It contained VLF experiments. It was used to conduct research into the propagation of very low frequency radio signals in the ionosphere, and to investigate if these signals could be received by submarines.
