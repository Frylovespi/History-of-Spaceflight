    description = SOLRAD (SOLar RADiation) 4B was a solar X-ray, ultraviolet, and electronic surveillance satellite. Developed by the United States Navy's Naval Research Laboratory, it was the fifth in both the SOLRAD and the GRAB (Galactic Radiation and Background) programs. This satellite was the only SOLRAD to be launched from Vandenberg, to be launched via Scout rocket, and to be launched unaccompanied by any other satellites. Launched on April 26, 1962, a fourth stage failure resulted in payload impact 225 nautical miles downrange. SOLRAD 4B was the last of the SOLRAD/GRAB missions, future SOLRADs being launched with the National Reconnaissance Office's (NRO) next-generation Poppy satellites. SOLRAD 4B had a mass of 91.0 kg. The mission ended in failure when the second stage failed to ignite.
