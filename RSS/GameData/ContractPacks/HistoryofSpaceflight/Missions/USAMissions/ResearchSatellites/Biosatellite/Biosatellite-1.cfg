	description = Biosatellite 1, also known as Biosat 1 and as Biosatellite A, was the first satellite belonging to the Biosatellite Program for biological research. It carried biological specimens to determine the effects of the space environment on life processes. The reentry vehicle separated but the rocket failed, leaving the capsule in a slowly decaying orbit.  It re-entered and disintegrated on February 15, 1967. No useful scientific data was obtained. It had a mass of 950.0 kg.
