	description = Biosatellite 2, also known as abbreviated as Biosat 2 and as Biosatellite B, was the second satellite belonging to the Biosatellite Program for biological research. It carried 13 experiments involving insects, frog eggs, plants and microorganisms. The capsule returned ahead of time because of the tropical storm threat in the recovery area and communication problems between the capsule and ground stations. The main objective of the mission was to determine if the level of radiation sensitivity of living organisms in space is greater, or less than on land. It had a mass of 955.0 kg.

	notes = Launch the Biosatellite 2 biological research satellite into low Earth orbit and recover the specimens after 2 days in orbit.
