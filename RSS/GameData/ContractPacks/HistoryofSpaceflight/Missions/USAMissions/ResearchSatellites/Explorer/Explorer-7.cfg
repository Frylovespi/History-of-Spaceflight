	description = Explorer 7 was designed to measure solar X-ray and Lyman-alpha flux, trapped energetic particles, and heavy primary cosmic rays (Z>5). It was the last of the seven satellites that the United States orbited for the IGY. Secondary objectives included collecting data on micrometeorite penetration and molecular sputtering and studying the earth-atmosphere heat balance. The spin-stabilized satellite's external structure consisted of two truncated conical fiberglass shells joined by a cylindrical aluminum center section. Explorer 7 had a mass of 41.5 kg.
