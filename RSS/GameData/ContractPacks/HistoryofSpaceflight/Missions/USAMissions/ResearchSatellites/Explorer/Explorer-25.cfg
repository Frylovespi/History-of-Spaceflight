         description = Explorer 25 was a magnetically aligned satellite launched simultaneously with Explorer 24 (AD-B) (Air Density experiment). The satellite's primary mission was to make measurements of the influx of energetic particles into the earth's atmosphere and to study atmospheric heating and the increase in scale height which have been correlated with geomagnetic activity. Studies of the natural and artificial trapped radiation belts were also conducted. A biaxial fluxgate magnetometer was used to monitor the orientation of the spacecraft with respect to the local magnetic field. It had a mass of 40.0 kg and was launched from a Scout rocket from the Vandenberg AFB launch site on November 21, 1964.
