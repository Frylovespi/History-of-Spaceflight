	description = Explorer 21, also called IMP-B and Interplanetary Monitoring Platform IMP-B, was a 138.0 kg solar-cell and chemical-battery powered spacecraft instrumented for interplanetary and distant magnetospheric studies of energetic particles, cosmic rays, magnetic fields, and plasmas. Explorer 21 was the second satellite of the Interplanetary Monitoring Platform.&br;&br;Explorer 21 was placed in a highly elliptical geocentric orbit with an apogee of 94,288 km, a perigee of 917 km, an inclination of 33.7 degrees, and an orbital period of 2,080 minutes. The mission ended with a loss of contact with the spacecraft on October 13, 1965. It decayed from orbit on January 1, 1966.
