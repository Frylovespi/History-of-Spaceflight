	description = Explorer 31 was a small 98.9 kg ionospheric observatory instrumented to make direct measurements of selected ionospheric parameters at the spacecraft. It carried seven experiments: a thermal ion experiment, a thermal electron experiment, an electrostatic probe, an electron temperature probe, a spherical mass spectrometer, an energetic electron current monitor, and a magnetic ion-mass spectrometer. Since the spacecraft had no tape recorder, data could be observed at the spacecraft only when the spacecraft was in sight of the telemetry station and when commanded on. Experiments were operated either simultaneously or sequentially, as desired. The satellite was spin-stabilized with the spin axis perpendicular to the orbit plane.&br;&br;Explorer 31 was placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 2,978 km, a perigee of 505 km, an inclination of 79.8 degrees, and an orbital period of 121.4 minutes. The mission ended when the spacecraft decayed from orbit on February 21, 1967.
