	description = Explorer 34, also known as IMP-4 and Interplanetary Monitoring Platform IMP-F, was placed into a high-inclination, highly eccentric earth orbit. The apogee point was located near the ecliptic plane and had an initial local time of about 1900 h. The spacecraft was a 163 kg spin-stabilized spacecraft and had an initial spin period of 2.6 s. The spin vector was approximately perpendicular to the ecliptic plane. Like the earlier IMPs, this spacecraft was instrumented to study interplanetary magnetic fields, energetic particles, and plasma.&br;&br;Explorer 34 was placed in a highly elliptical geocentric orbit with an apogee of 209,242 km, a perigee of 2,031 km, an inclination of 68.5 degrees, and an orbital period of 6,218.3 minutes. Thespacecraft optical aspect system failed on 4 March 1969. Otherwise, useful data were acquired until just before the spacecraft decayed from orbit on May 3, 1969.
