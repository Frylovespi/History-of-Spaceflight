    description = Explorer 13, also called S-55A, was injected into a geocentric orbit of moderate eccentricity using a Scout launch vehicle. The objectives of the flight were to test vehicle performance and guidance and to investigate the nature and effects of micrometeorites on the spacecraft systems. No penetrations were recorded by this satellite during experiment operations. The scientific instrumentation consisted of cadmium sulfide-cell, wire-grid, piezoelectric, pressurized-cell, and foil-type micrometeorite detectors. The orbit was lower than planned, and the spacecraft reentered the atmosphere on August 28, 1961, after only slightly more than 2 days in orbit.&br;&br;Explorer 13 was placed in a low Earth orbit with a perigee of 125 km, an apogee of 1,164 km, an inclination of 37.7 degrees, and an orbital period of 97.5 minutes. The mission ended with a loss of contact on August 25, 1961.
