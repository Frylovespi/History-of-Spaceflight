	description = Explorer 35, also known as IMP-E, AIMP 2, Anchored IMP 2, Interplanetary Monitoring Platform-E, was a 230.0 kg spin-stabilized spacecraft instrumented for interplanetary studies, at lunar distances, of the interplanetary plasma, magnetic field, energetic particles, and solar X rays. It was launched into an elliptical lunar orbit. The spin axis direction was nearly perpendicular to the ecliptic plane, and the spin rate was 25.6 rpm.&br;&br;Explorer 35 was placed in an elliptical lunar orbit with an Aposelene altitude of 7,886 km, a Periselene altitude of 764 km, an inclination of 147.3 degrees, and an orbital period of 710 minutes. Mission objectives were achieved. After successful operation for 6 years, the spacecraft was turned off on June 24, 1973.
