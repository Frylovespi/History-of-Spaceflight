	description = Explorer 24, also known as AD-B and S-56C, was placed in orbit together with Explorer 25 from a single launch vehicle. Explorer 24 was identical in configuration to the previously launched balloon satellites Explorer 9 and 19. The spacecraft was 3.6 m in diameter, was built of alternating layers of aluminum foil and plastic film, and was covered uniformly with 5.1-cm white dots for thermal control. It was designed to yield atmospheric density near perigee as a function of space and time from sequential observations of the sphere's position in orbit. It had a mass of 8.6 kg.&br;&br;Explorer 25 was a magnetically aligned satellite launched simultaneously with Explorer 24 (AD-B) (Air Density experiment). The satellite's primary mission was to make measurements of the influx of energetic particles into the earth's atmosphere and to study atmospheric heating and the increase in scale height which have been correlated with geomagnetic activity. Studies of the natural and artificial trapped radiation belts were also conducted. A bi-axial fluxgate magnetometer was used to monitor the orientation of the spacecraft with respect to the local magnetic field. It had a mass of 40.0 kg.&br;&br;Explorer 24 and Explorer 25 were placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 2,498 km, a perigee of 525 km, an inclination of 81.4 degrees, and an orbital period of 116.3 minutes. The Explorer 24 mission ended with the loss of contact with the spacecraft on October 18, 1968. The Explorer 25 mission ended with a loss of contact with the spacecraft in late February 1965.
