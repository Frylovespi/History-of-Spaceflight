    description = Explorer 12 was a 37.6 kg spin-stabilized, solar-cell-powered spacecraft instrumented to measure cosmic-ray particles, trapped particles, solar wind protons, and magnetospheric and interplanetary magnetic fields. It was the first of the S 3 series of spacecraft, which also included Explorers 14, 15, and 26. The spacecraft functioned well until December 6, 1961, when it ceased transmitting data apparently as a result of failures in the power system. Good data were recorded for approximately 90% of the active lifetime of the spacecraft.&br;&br;Explorer 12 was placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 77,620 km, a perigee of 790 km, an inclination of 33.4 degrees, and an orbital period of 1,587 minutes. The mission ended with a loss of contact on December 6, 1961 and it decayed from orbit on September 1, 1963.
