         description = Explorer 15 was a spin-stabilized, solar-cell-powered spacecraft instrumented to study the artificial radiation belt produced by the Starfish high-altitude nuclear burst of July 1962. The backup payload for Explorer 14 was modified and used for Explorer 15. The instrumentation included three sets of particle detectors to study both electrons and protons, and a two-axis fluxgate magnetometer to determine magnetic aspect. It was the third of the S 3 series of spacecraft, which also included Explorers 12 and 14. It had a mass of 44.4 kg and was launched from a Thor-Delta rocket from the Cape Canaveral launch site on October 27, 1961.
