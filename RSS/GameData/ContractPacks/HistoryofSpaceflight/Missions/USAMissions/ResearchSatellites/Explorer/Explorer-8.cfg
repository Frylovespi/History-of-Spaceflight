    description = Explorer 8 was a 41 kg mercury-battery-powered, earth-orbiting satellite designed to obtain measurements of the electron density, the electron temperature, the ion concentration, the ion mass, the micrometeorite distribution, and the micrometeorite mass in the ionosphere at altitudes between 400 and 1600 km. It was intended to study the temporal and spatial distribution of these properties and their variation from full sunlit conditions to full shadow, or nighttime, conditions. To avoid the possibility of effects on the experiments by asymmetrical charging on solar cell surfaces, solar cells were not used. Experiment instrumentation included an RF impedance probe, an ion current monitor, a retarding potential probe, a two-element and a three-element electron temperature probe, an electron current monitor, a photomultiplier-type and a microphone-type micrometeorite detector, an electric field meter, a solar horizon sensor, and thermistor temperature probes.&br;&br;Explorer 8 was placed in a medium Earth orbit with an apogee of 2,286 km, a perigee of 416 km, an inclination of 49.9 degrees, and an orbital period of 112.7 minutes. The mission ended with a loss of contact on December 27, 1960 and the satellite decayed from orbit on March 28, 2012.
