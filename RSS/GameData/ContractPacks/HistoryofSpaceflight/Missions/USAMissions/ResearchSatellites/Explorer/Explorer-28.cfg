         description = Explorer 28 (IMP 3) was a solar-cell and chemical-battery powered spacecraft instrumented for interplanetary and distant magnetospheric studies of energetic particles, cosmic rays, magnetic fields, and plasmas. Initial spacecraft parameters included a local time of apogee of 2020 h, a spin rate of 23.7 rpm, and a spin direction of 64.9-deg right ascension and -10.9-deg declination. It had a mass of 128.0 kg and was launched from a Thor-Delta rocket from the Cape Canaveral launch site on May 29, 1965.
