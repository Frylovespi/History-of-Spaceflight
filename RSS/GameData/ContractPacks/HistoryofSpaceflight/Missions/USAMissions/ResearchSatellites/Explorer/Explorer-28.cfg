	description = Explorer 28, also known as IMP-3 and IMP-C, was a 128.0 kg solar-cell and chemical-battery powered spacecraft instrumented for interplanetary and distant magnetospheric studies of energetic particles, cosmic rays, magnetic fields, and plasmas. Initial spacecraft parameters included a local time of apogee of 2020 h, a spin rate of 23.7 rpm, and a spin direction of 64.9-deg right ascension and -10.9-deg declination.  &br;&br;Explorer 28 was placed in a highly elliptical geocentric orbit with an apogee of 261,206 km, a perigee of 229 km and an inclination of 30.5 degrees. Performance was normal until mid-April 1967, when intermittent problems began. It stayed in contact until May 12, 1967, when contact was lost. The orbit kept going lower and lower until it re-entered on July 4, 1968.
