	description = Explorer 19 was the second in a series of 3.66 m, 7.7 kg, inflatable spheres placed into orbit to determine atmospheric densities. Explorer 19 was launched while Explorer 9, the first satellite in the series, was still active, so that densities in two different portions of the atmosphere were sampled simultaneously. It was identical to Explorer 9. The spacecraft consisted of alternating layers of aluminum foil and Mylar polyester film. Uniformly distributed over the aluminum surface were 5.1 cm diameter dots of white paint for thermal control. The sphere was packed in a tube 21.6 cm diameter and 48.3 cm long. It was mounted in the nose of the fourth stage of the launch vehicle. Upon separation of the fourth stage, the sphere was inflated by a nitrogen gas bottle, and a separation spring ejected it out into its own orbit.&br;&br;Explorer 19 was placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 2,394 km, a perigee of 590 km, an inclination of 78.6 degrees, and an orbital period of 115.9 minutes. The mission ended when the spacecraft decayed from orbit on May 10, 1981.
