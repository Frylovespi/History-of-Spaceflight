	description = Explorer 22 (BE-B) was a small 52.6 kg ionospheric research satellite instrumented with an electrostatic probe, a 20-, 40-, and 41-Hz radio beacon, a passive laser tracking reflector, and a Doppler navigation experiment. Its objective was to obtain worldwide observations of total electron content between the spacecraft and the earth. The satellite was initially spin-stabilized, but it was de-spun after solar paddle erection. Subsequent stabilization oriented the satellite axis of symmetry with the local magnetic field by means of a strong bar magnet and damping rods. A three-axis magnetometer and sun sensors provided information on the satellite attitude and spin rate.&br;&br;Explorer 22 was placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 1,081 km, a perigee of 889 km, an inclination of 79.7 degrees, and an orbital period of 104.8 minutes. The mission ended with the loss of contact with the spacecraft in February of 1965.
