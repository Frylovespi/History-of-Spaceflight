    description = Explorer 11, also known as S15, was launched for the purpose of detecting the sources of high-energy gamma rays. It carried the first space-borne gamma-ray telescope. This was the earliest beginning of space gamma-ray astronomy. In addition to detecting gamma rays, Explorer 11 was designed to map their direction with emphasis on the plane of the galaxy, the galactic center, the sun, and other known radio noise sources; to relate the measurements to the cosmic-ray flux density and the density of interstellar matter; and to measure the high-energy gamma-ray albedo of the earth's atmosphere.&br;&br;Explorer 11 was a spin-stabilized octagonal aluminum box (30.5 by 30.5 by 58.5 cm) on a cylinder (15.2 cm in diameter and 52.2 cm long), and had a mass of 37.2 kg. It was placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 1,100 km, a perigee of 300 km, an inclination of 28.89 degrees, and an orbital period of 2,184 minutes. The mission ended with a loss of contact with the satellite on November 17, 1961.
