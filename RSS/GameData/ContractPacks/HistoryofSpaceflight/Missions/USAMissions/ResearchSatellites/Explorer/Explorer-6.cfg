	description = Explorer 6 was a small 64.4 kg spheroidal satellite designed to study trapped radiation of various energies, galactic cosmic rays, geomagnetism, radio propagation in the upper atmosphere, and the flux of micrometeorites. It also tested a scanning device designed for photographing the earth's cloud cover. The satellite was launched into a highly elliptical orbit.&br;&br;Explorer 6 was placed in highly elliptical Earth orbit with an apogee of 7,870 km, a perigee of 237 km, an inclination of 47 degrees, and an orbital period of 754 minutes. The mission ended with a loss of contact with the satellite on October 6, 1959 and it decayed from orbit on July 1, 1961.
