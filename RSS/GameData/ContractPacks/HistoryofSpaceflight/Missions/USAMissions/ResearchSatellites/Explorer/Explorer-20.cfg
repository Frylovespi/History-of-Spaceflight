	description = Explorer 20, also known Ionosphere Explorer IE-A, was designed to measure electron distribution, ion density and temperature, and to estimate cosmic noise levels between 2 and 7 MHz. The satellite was a small ionospheric observatory instrumented with a six-frequency ionospheric sounder and an ion probe. Six sounding antennas (three dipoles) extended from the satellite equator, one pair of 18.28 m antennas forming the dipole used for low frequencies, the other two dipoles consisting of four 9.14 m antennas. It had a mass of 44.5 kg. It was expected that information gathered from Explorer 20 would help in the study of long-range radio transmissions, particularly the cause of periodic radio black-outs.&br;&br;Explorer 20 was placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 625 km, a perigee of 540 km, an inclination of 79.9 degrees, and an orbital period of 104 minutes. The mission ended with the loss of contact with the spacecraft on December 20, 1965.
