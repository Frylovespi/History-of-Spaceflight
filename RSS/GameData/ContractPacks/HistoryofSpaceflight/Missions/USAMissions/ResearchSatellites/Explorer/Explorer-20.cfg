         description = Explorer 20 was designed to measure electron distribution, ion density and temperature, and to estimate cosmic noise levels between 2 and 7 MHz. The satellite was a small ionospheric observatory instrumented with a six-frequency ionospheric sounder and an ion probe. It had a mass of 44.5 kg and was launched from a Scout rocket from the Vandenberg AFB launch site on August 25, 1964.
