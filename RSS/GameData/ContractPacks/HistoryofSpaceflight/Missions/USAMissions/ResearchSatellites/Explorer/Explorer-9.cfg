    description = Explorer 9 was the first in a series of 3.66 m, 36.0 kg, inflatable spheres to be successfully placed into orbit solely for the determination of atmospheric densities. It was the first spacecraft placed in orbit by an all-solid rocket and the first spacecraft successfully launched into orbit from Wallops Island. The spacecraft consisted of alternating layers of aluminum foil and Mylar polyester film. Uniformly distributed over the aluminum surface were 5.1 cm-diameter dots of white paint for thermal control. The sphere was packed in a tube 21.6 cm in diameter and 48.3 cm long and mounted in the nose of the fourth stage of the launch vehicle. Upon separation of the third and fourth stages, the ejection bellows, a nitrogen gas bottle, inflated the sphere and a separation spring ejected it out into its own orbit.&br;&br;Explorer 9 was placed in medium Earth orbit with an apogee of 2,581 km, a perigee of 635 km, an inclination of 38.8 degrees, and an orbital period of 118.4 minutes. The mission ended when it decayed from orbit on April 9, 1964.
