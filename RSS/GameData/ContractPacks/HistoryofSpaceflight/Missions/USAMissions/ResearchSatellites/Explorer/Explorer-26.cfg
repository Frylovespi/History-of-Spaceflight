	description = Explorer 26, also known as EPE-D and S-3C, was a 45.8 kg spin-stabilized, solar-cell-powered spacecraft launched by the United States in 1964. It was instrumented to measure trapped particles and the geomagnetic field. A 16-channel PFM/PM time-division multiplexed telemeter was used. Half of the channels were used to convey eight-level digital information. The other channels were used for analog information. During ground processing, the analog information was digitized with an accuracy of 1/800th of full scale.&br;&br;Explorer 26 was placed in a medium Earth orbit with an apogee of 8,545 km, a perigee of 171 km, an inclination of 18.1 degrees, and an orbital period of 184.5 minutes. The spacecraft systems functioned well, except for some under-voltage turnoffs, until May 26, 1967, when the telemeter failed.
