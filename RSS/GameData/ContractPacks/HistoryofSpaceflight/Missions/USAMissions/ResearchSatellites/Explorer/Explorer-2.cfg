	description = Explorer 2 was to be a repeat of the Explorer 1 mission. However, due to a failure in the fourth stage rocket during launch, the spacecraft did not reach orbit and fell back to Earth. Explorer 2 was equipped with a Geiger counter for the purposes of detecting cosmic rays. After Explorer 3, it was decided that the original Geiger counter had been overwhelmed by strong radiation coming from a belt of charged particles trapped in space by the Earth's magnetic field. Explorer 2 was also equipped with a wire grid array and an acoustic detector for the purpose of micrometeorite detection.
