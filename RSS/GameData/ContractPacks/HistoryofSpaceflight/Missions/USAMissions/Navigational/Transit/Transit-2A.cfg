	description = The Navy Transit 2A contained a navigation payload experiment. It demonstrated the feasibility of using satellites as navigational aids. Transit spacecraft were developed for updating the inertial navigation systems on board US Navy Polaris submarines, and later for civilian use. The receivers used the known characteristics of the satellites orbit, measured the Doppler shift of the satellites radio signal, and thereby calculated the receivers position on the earth.&br;&br;SOLRAD 1, also known as GRAB 1, was a solar radiation experiment satellite launched piggybacked on Transit 2A in a multiple payload experiment. Solrad was a 50 cm diameter sphere, with a weight of 19 kg. SOLRAD had a dual mission: a scientific radiation experiment (SOLRAD) and a classified electronic intelligence (elint) mission (GRAB).
