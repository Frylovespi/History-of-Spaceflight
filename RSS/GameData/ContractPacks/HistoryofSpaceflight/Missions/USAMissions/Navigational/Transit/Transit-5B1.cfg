	description = Transit 5BN-1 was a 70 kg navigation satellite developed for updating the inertial navigation systems onboard U.S. Navy Polaris submarines. It carried a SNAP 3 nuclear power source. The satellite developed a problem that kept it from being fully useful as an operational satellite for navigation: It achieved gravity-gradient stabilization upside down, and thus the signal level was too low for operational use with low-gain antennas. However, geodetic and navigational evaluation data were obtained.&br;&br;Transit 5E-1 was a 61 kg solar powered navigation technology satellite developed to obtain environmental data in the vicinity of the operational orbit of Transit satellites. Mission objectives were: to measure omni-directional flux of protons and electrons above certain threshold energies in order to determine the temporal variations in the radiation environment; verify information pertinent to radiation effects on various transistors; determine the effectiveness of seven selected thermal coatings; determine the effectiveness of protective coatings on solar cells in preventing degradation due to radiation; and increase knowledge of the earth's shape and gravitational field. All 5E-1 mission objectives were met and the satellite has become one of the most productive satellites ever launched. Data were acquired routinely for over six years and the satellite has functioned for a full solar cycle (11 years).&br;&br;The APL SN-39 59 kg  satellite was a magnetically aligned spacecraft designed to measure energetic charged particles, magnetic fields, and the solar spectrum, and to acquire geodetic data. After August 1969, it sampled its environment only infrequently. The last data was transmitted during November 1974. The mission was highly successful.
