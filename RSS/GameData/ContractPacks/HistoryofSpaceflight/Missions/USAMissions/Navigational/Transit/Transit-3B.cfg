    description = The Navy Transit 3B contained a navigation payload experiment. It demonstrated the feasibility of using satellites as navigational aids. Transit spacecraft were developed for updating the inertial navigation systems on board US Navy Polaris submarines, and later for civilian use. The receivers used the known characteristics of the satellites orbit, measured the Doppler shift of the satellites radio signal, and thereby calculated the receivers position on the earth. Also hitchhiking on this launch was the LOFTI 1 satellite. It was released in the same orbit as Transit-3B. They had a combined mass of 600 kg.
