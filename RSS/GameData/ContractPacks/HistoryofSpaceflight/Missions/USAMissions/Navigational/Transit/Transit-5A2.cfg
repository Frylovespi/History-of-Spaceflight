	description = Transit 5A-2 was an 84 kg navigation satellite. It was the second of the Transit operational prototype satellites, but it failed to achieve orbit. It was reported that USAF launched an unidentified satellite with a Blue Scout rocket, but Astronautic and Aerospace Engineering reported that USN made a second attempt to place an operational Transit navigational satellite into orbit, and said the spacecraft failed to attain orbit because of malfunction in the fourth stage of USN Blue Scout booster.

	notes = Launch the Transit 5A navigational satellite and fail to reach orbit.
