	description = Transit 5B-4, also known as Transit O-1, was a 60-kg navigation satellite, also know as the Navy Navigation Satellite (NNS). The Transit-O series, that closely followed the design of Transit 5C-1, were also called "Oscars" (the phonetic alphabet for "O"), i.e., Operational. NSS O-1 failed after a few days operation. The first NNS O satellites were built by the Naval Avionics Facility at Indianapolis but, after O-1 and O-2 failed to operate more than a few days, APL refurbished the following ones and built new ones. The Transit series was developed for updating the inertial navigation systems on board U.S. Navy Polaris submarines.
