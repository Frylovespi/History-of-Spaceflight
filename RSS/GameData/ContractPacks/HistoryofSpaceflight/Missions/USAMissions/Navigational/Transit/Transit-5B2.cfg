	description = Transit 5BN-2 was a 70 kg navigation satellite developed for updating the inertial navigation systems on board U.S. Navy Polaris submarines. This was an operational prototype powered by a SNAP-9A nuclear power source. This transit became the first operational navigation satellite; it was used regularly by both surface and submarine units of the Navy until November 1964. From this point in time the Navy had continuous use of satellite navigation.&br;&br;Transit 5E-3 was a 53 kg navigation technology satellite designed to obtain environmental data in the vicinity of the operational orbit of Transit satellites. Mission objectives were: evaluate the effect on the operational system of refraction on radio signal propagation; test an experimental solid-state telemetry commutator; obtain flight test experience of battery-charge control by current limiting, since the charge control circuitry was intended for use in future satellites. Mission objectives were only partially met, satellite transmissions were last received on 19 July 1964.&br;&br;1963-049 is a still classified (as of October 2019) US Navy satellite that was launched piggyback with Transit 5E-3, and Transit 5BN-2.
