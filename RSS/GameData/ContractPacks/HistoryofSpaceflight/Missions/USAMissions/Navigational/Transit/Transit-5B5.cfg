	description = Transit 5B-5, also known as Transit O-2, was a 60-kg navigation satellite, also know as the Navy Navigation Satellite (NNS). The Transit-O series, that closely followed the design of Transit 5C-1, were also called "Oscars" (the phonetic alphabet for "O"), i.e., Operational. NSS O-1 failed after a few days operation. The first NNS O satellites were built by the Naval Avionics Facility at Indianapolis but, after O-1 and O-2 failed to operate more than a few days, APL refurbished the following ones and built new ones. The Transit series was developed for updating the inertial navigation systems on board U.S. Navy Polaris submarines.&br;&br;This mission also contained a piggyback Transit 5E satellite. The 77 kg solar powered Transit 5E-5 was launched to obtain environmental data in the vicinity of the operational orbit of Transit satellites. Transit 5E-5 featured following systems: two stable oscillators, transmitters, solar cells/Ni-Cd batteries, a Rubidium vapour magnetometer, a fluxgate magnetometer system, an ultraviolet telescope, omni-directional particle detectors, and a metallic sublimation experiment.
