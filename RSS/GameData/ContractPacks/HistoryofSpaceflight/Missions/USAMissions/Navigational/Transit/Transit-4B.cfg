    description = Transit 4B was a US Navy navigation satellite. It carried a SNAP-3 nuclear power source. Transit, one of the first operational satellite systems, was also known as the Navy Navigation Satellite (NNS). The Transit spacecraft were developed for updating the inertial navigation systems on board US Navy Polaris submarines, and later for civilian use. Transit receivers used the known characteristics of the satellite's orbit, measured the Doppler shift of the satellite's radio signal, and thereby calculated the receivers position on the earth. These signals were corrected for ionospheric refraction and the information was then fed into the users navigation system. The payload also contained the hitchhiker satellite TRAAC.&br;&br;\tThe Transit Research and Attitude Control (TRAAC) satellite was launched by the US Navy along with Transit 4B. It was used to test the feasibility of using the earth's gravitational attraction to orient and stabilize a vehicle in space. It was expected that the TRAAC satellite was in a position to measure the influence upon the Van Allen belt of the megaton-plus hydrogen device that exploded on 8 July 1962 at more than 300 km altitude. Lofted by a Thor rocket from Johnston Island in the Pacific as a part of Operation Dominic, it was the highest thermonuclear blast ever achieved and lighted up the Pacific sky from Wake Island to New Zealand, causing some communication disruption but less than predicted. TRAAC had a mass of 109.0 kg and Transit 4B had a mass of 79.0 kg.
