	description = Transit 5BN-3 was a 75 kg experimental navigation satellite that was lost following an undisclosed Delta launch failure. it carried a SNAP-9A nuclear power source and, after this launch failure, it was decided that operational Transits would be solar-powered only. On 7 May 1964, the Atomic Energy Commission announced a satellite carrying small SNAP-9A atomic generator had been launched on Thor-Able-Star booster from Vandenberg AFB last April 21, but it did not go into orbit. Preliminary data indicated the satellite burned up upon re-entry into Earth's atmosphere. AEC spokesman said about 1 kg of plutonium 238 had been lost over the west coast of Africa. Onboard as fuel for SNAP-9A generator, the plutonium apparently vaporized on re-entry into Earth's atmosphere and now was dispersed in very fine particles at the edge of space, where it would gradually lose its radioactivity. It posed "no health hazard to the world's population."&br;&br;Three 70 kg Transit 5E satellites were launched to obtain environmental data in the vicinity of the operational orbit of Transit satellites and used solar power. The objectives of Transit-5E 2 were: to map, to a high accuracy, the Earth's magnetic field at orbital altitude; to map the celestial sphere in the ultraviolet region; to demonstrate operation of a new digital solar attitude detection system; and to determine sublimation rates of cadmium, magnesium, and silver-plated cadmium. But the satellite failed to reach orbit.
