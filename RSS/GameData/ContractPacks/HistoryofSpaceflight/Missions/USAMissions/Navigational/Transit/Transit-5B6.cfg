	description = Transit-5B6, also known as Transit O-4, was a US Navy navigation satellite. It carried a SNAP 9A nuclear power source. Transit, one of the first operational satellite systems, was also known as the Navy Navigation Satellite (NNS). Transit was superseded by the GPS global positioning system. The use of the satellites for navigation was discontinued at the end of 1996 but the satellites continued transmitting and became the Navy Ionospheric Monitoring System (NIMS).
