	description = SECOR 4 was a small geodetic satellite used to precisely determine points on the earth. It was launched by the WSMC as a joint venture of the US Army and Navy to locate Pacific islands. Experiments with these led to Timation, and finally to the GPS Navstar system. It had a mass of 18.0 kg.&br;&br;Snapshot (Space Nuclear Auxiliary Power Shot) satellite was launched as a test-bed for the SNAP 10A nuclear power system, and a cesium ion engine. The SNAP power system operated successfully for about 43 days, but the ion engine operated for a period of less than 1 hour before being commanded off permanently. Analysis of flight data indicated a significant number of high-voltage breakdowns, and this apparently caused sufficient EMI to induce false horizon sensor signals leading to severe attitude perturbations of the spacecraft.
