    description = SAMOS 4 was a US Air Force first generation photo surveillance satellite launched from the Vandenberg Air Force Base aboard an Atlas Agena-B rocket. It was the 4th in the series of Satellite and Missile Observation Satellites and failed to reach orbit. Four minutes and four seconds into the flight, the rocket's first stage attitude control system malfunctioned, and control over the rocket's pitch was lost. The rest of the flight proceeded nominally, however by the time the second stage ignited it had pitched up by 160 degrees and was hence facing in the wrong direction. Its three-minute-41-second burn reduced the vehicle's velocity instead of increasing it, and as a result the satellite failed to achieve orbit.
