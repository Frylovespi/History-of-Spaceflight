	description = SAMOS 7 was equipped with infrared sensors for measuring both thermal emissions and reflected solar radiation from the earth and its atmosphere. The satellite consisted of a cylindrical rocket body approximately 6 m long and 1.5 m in diameter. The spacecraft burned up during reentry 3 days after launch. It has a mass of 1588.0 kg. Onboard this flight was a small piggyback satellite PVP 851&br;&br;PVP 851 was a small scientific satellite designed by the Air Force Cambridge Research Labs (AFCRL). It included neutron albedo measurements, electron number density and retarding potential analyzer instruments, an infrared radiometer, and a nuclear emulsion experiment to measure cosmic radiation. Some of the experiment data was transmitted by antenna, but the majority of the data and all of the reconnaissance images from the SAMOS 7 flight were lost when the satellite recovery vehicle (SRV) failed to deploy its parachute.
