	description = This electronic intelligence satellite is sometime called Ferret 4 or Ferret 5, "Heavy Ferrets" or SAMOS-F3. It was reportedly the first of three SAMOS-F3, which weight around 1,500 kg and served to catalogued Soviet air defense radars, eavesdropped on voice communications and taped missile and satellite telemetry. (It also could be a “military naval signals reconnaissance satellite.”) The SAMOS-F3 satellites were known for decades as "Heavy Ferrets" and were an improved version of the preceding SAMOS-F2 series based on the improved Agena-D stage. Ferret-5 had a mass of 1500 kg (including Agena).
