	description = The Ferret 1 USAF ELINT satellite was launched from Vandenberg AFB aboard a Thor Agena D rocket. The Ferrets cataloged Soviet air defense radars, eavesdropped on voice communications, and taped missile and satellite telemetry. They are still classified as of January 2019. The Ferret 1 mission ended in partial failure as the second stage Agena failed to restart for the planned circularization burn. It therefore stayed in its initial transfer orbit until it decayed. Ferret 1 had a mass of 1100 kg (including Agena).

	notes = Launch Ferret 1 into polar orbit but fail to circularize due to Agena failure.
	synopsis = <color=yellow>Ferret 1 was launched by a Thor Agena D on February 21, 1962 from Vandenberg AFB Launch Complex.</color>
