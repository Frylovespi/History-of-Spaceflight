	description = MIDAS 11, also known as MIDAS-RTS-2 (Research Test Satellite 2), was an extension to the MIDAS program of early warning satellites. It was designed to detect, in real-time, lower-radiance sea-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs), and be capable of determining their launch locations, on two sightings, within a range of 8-to-1O nm, The radiant characteristics of all of the missiles detected around the world also would be identified, measured, and catalogued. MIDAS 11 was launched along with two piggyback satellites into their intended circular polar orbits. MIDAS operated for 11 months. During this period this spacecraft detected all Soviet and U.S. ballistic missiles launched within it's field of view.&br;&br;SECOR 7 (Sequential Collation of Range), also known as EGRS 7 (Electronic & Geodetic Ranging Satellite), was a small geodetic spacecraft used to precisely determine points on the Earth. It was an all-weather geodetic survey system which was in operational use for several years, establishing a global survey network. It used the successive positions of artificial satellites in space to determine locations on the earth's surface with exactness over long distances. SECOR 7 was launched piggyback with MIDAS 11 and ERS 15. It had a mass of 17 kg.&br;&br;ERS 15 (ORS 1), was a continuation of the Environmental Research Satellites Program by the United States Air Force Office of Aerospace Research. The basic configuration of the ORS Mk.2 spacecrafts was a regular octahedron measuring 23 cm on a side. Solar cells mounted on each side of the faces provide sufficient electrical power to operate the experiments and the telemetry system when the satellite is illuminated by the sun. No internal battery or control system were provided. The satellite subsystems consisted of electrical power, antenna, telemetry, experiments, and mechanical structure. ERS 15 carried out cold welding experiments using eight different material combinations which were fused using actuators. It had a mass of 5 kg.
