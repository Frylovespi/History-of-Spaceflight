	description = MIDAS 6 was the first satellite of the MIDAS Series 3 early warning system. The basic spacecraft remained unchanged from the Series II, except for reliability upgrades. The Agena-B upper stage of the Atlas-LV3 Agena-B launch vehicle was used as the spacecraft bus and provided power and attitude control to the MIDAS payload. Two deployable solar arrays were mounted on the aft equipment rack of the Agena-B to provide power. Onboard this flight were two piggyback satellites from the ERS Program. The mission with the destruction of the Atlas booster at +82 seconds due to a failure in the Atlas hydraulics.&br;&br;ERS 2 (Environmental Research Satellites) were built by TRW Systems Group for the United States Air Force Office of Aerospace Research (AFOAR). Depending on the shape, these satellites are also referred to as the Tetrahedral Research Satellite (TRS) or Octahedral Research Satellite (ORS). ERS 2 was equipped with a transmitter to study the changes in the Earth's radiation belt as a result of the Starfish high altitude nuclear test detonation over Johnston Island on 9 July 1962, as well as to study the effect of such radiation on solar cells.&br;&br;ERS 3 conducted radiation and micrometeorite studies, it carried a cosmic ray experiment as well as an infrared plume experiment. Both Piggyback satellites were destroyed along with MIDAS 6 with the execution of the range safety.
