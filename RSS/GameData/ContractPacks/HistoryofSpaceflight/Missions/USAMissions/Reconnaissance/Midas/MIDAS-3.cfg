	description = MIDAS 3 was the first of the MIDAS Series 2 of the Military Defense Alarm System. One of the two solar arrays had failed to deploy properly. MIDAS Series 2 carried a new infrared payload built by Baird-Atomic, one that featured 175 detectors capable of sensing ICBM targets at a maximum slant range of 4200 nm, The payload was designed to scan at a rate of 6 rpm, a rate of rotation three times faster than the Series I payloads. Only limited payload data was obtained before a power failure occurred in the Agena. The mission was over after five orbits.
