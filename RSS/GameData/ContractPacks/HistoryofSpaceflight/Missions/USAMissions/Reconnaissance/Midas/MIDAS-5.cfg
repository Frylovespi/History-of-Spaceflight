	description = MIDAS 5, the third and last of the Series 2 flights carrying a Baird-Atomic infrared payload, lifted from Vandenberg AFB on 9 April 1962. The spacecraft achieve its planned polar orbit, stabilized properly, and the solar arrays extended and began generating the needed electrical power. Turned on, the infrared payload checked-out during the first few orbits of the Earth. During the sixth orbit a massive electrical power failure occurred aboard MIDAS 5, and all control over the vehicle was lost.&br;&br;West Ford Drag was a piggyback satellite launched along with MIDAS 5. It was the USAF's second attempt to orbit a belt of copper filaments in the Project West Ford experiment. Dr. W. E. Morrow, Jr., of MIT’s Lincoln Laboratory, reports that Project West Ford had “demonstrated that a significant communications capacity between large ground terminals can be provided by a dipole-belt so diffused as to be barely detectable by optical astronomers and virtually undetectable by radio astronomers.” He disclosed that only about half of the 400 million released dipoles had proved effective as signal reflectors, but the project “has already fulfilled virtually all its major objectives.”
