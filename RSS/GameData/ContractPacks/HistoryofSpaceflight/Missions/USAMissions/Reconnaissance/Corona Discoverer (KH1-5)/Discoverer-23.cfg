	description = Discoverer 23 was a USAF photographic surveillance satellite designed to assess how rapidly the Soviet Union was producing long-range bombers and ballistic missiles, and where they were being deployed. It was part of the Corona program which was also used to produce maps and charts for the Department of Defense and other US government mapping programs. It was the second KH-5 mission to be launched, and the second to end in failure. The satellite used a film canister that was returned to earth in a capsule (a.k.a. bucket) for evaluation. These capsules were designed to be recovered by a specially equipped aircraft during parachute descent, but were also designed to float to permit recovery from the ocean. All film were black and white.\n\nDiscoverer 23 ejected its film canister in the wrong direction due to a problem with its attitude control system, the SRV ended up boosting itself into a higher orbit rather than deorbiting. Discoverer 23 decayed from orbit on 16 April 1962, followed by the SRV on 23 May 1962.
