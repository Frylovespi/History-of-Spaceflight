    description = Discoverer 34 was a USAF photographic surveillance satellite designed to access how rapidly the Soviet Union was producing long-range bombers and ballistic missiles. Although the satellite achieved orbit, and was assigned the Harvard designation 1961 Alpha Epsilon 1, the launch was unsuccessful. An anomalous angle taken during ascent resulted in the spacecraft being placed into an unusable orbit. It was the second consecutive KH-3 launch failure. Due to the launch failure, and a problem with a gas valve on the spacecraft, recovery of the SRV was not attempted. Discoverer 34 decayed from orbit on 7 December 1962.
