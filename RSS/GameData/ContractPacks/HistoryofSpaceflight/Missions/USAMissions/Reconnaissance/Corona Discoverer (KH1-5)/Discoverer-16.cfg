	description = Discoverer 16 was a first generation, low resolution Air Force surveillance satellite launched from the Vandenberg AFB by a Thor Agena-B rocket. The launched failed when the second stage failed to separate. Discoverer-16 was the first satellite of the new KH-2 generation in the Corona program.&br;&br;The KH-2 payload consisted of the improved C' (Corona prime) single panoramic camera and a single General Electric return vehicle (SRV, Satellite Return Vehicle). The improved and simplified C'-camera was built by the Fairchild Camera Co. and with a f/5.0 aperture and 61 cm focal length had a ground resolution of 10.7 m. The satellite was based on the larger Agena-B upper stage, which provided attitude control in orbit. The film return capsule carried its own small solid-fuel retro motor to deorbit at the end of the mission with mid-air recovery of the returning capsule by a specially equipped aircraft.
