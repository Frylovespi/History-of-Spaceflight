	description = Discoverer 38 was an earth-orbiting satellite designed to improve satellite control, to test various space vehicle components, to continue evaluation of the Agena vehicle and recovery system, to conduct experiments in radio propagation, radiation effect, and instrumentation for nuclear explosion detection, and to eject and recover a reentry capsule. In addition to the usual Discoverer series instrumentation and telemetry, the payload included a horizon scanner, radiation measuring instruments, cosmic-ray monitors, magnetometers, an impedance reconnaissance satellite, and a radio propagation reconnaissance satellite operating on 20.005 and 40 MHz.&br;&br;Discoverer-38 was the first KH-4 satellite to be launched. KH-4 (Keyhole-4) was fourth version in the Corona-program to build an optical reconnaissance satellite. Only the first two satellites were launched under the name Discoverer, before this designation was dropped.&br;&br;The reentry capsule successfully separated from the Agena B after 65 orbits, decelerated, reentered the atmosphere, and was recovered in mid-air. The Agena B remainded in orbit and continued to transmit data until it reentered the atmosphere and burned up on March 21, 1962.
