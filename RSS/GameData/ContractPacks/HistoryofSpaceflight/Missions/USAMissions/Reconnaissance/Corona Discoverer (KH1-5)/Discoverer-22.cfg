	description = Discoverer 22, also known as Corona 9015, was an American optical reconnaissance satellite which was lost in a launch failure in 1961. It was a KH-2 Corona satellite, based on an Agena-B. Due to a malfunction of the rocket's second stage, it failed to achieve orbit. Discoverer 22 was to have operated in a low Earth orbit. It was equipped with a panoramic camera with a focal length of 61 centimeters (24 in), which had a maximum resolution of 7.6 meters (25 ft). Images were to have been recorded onto 70-millimeter (2.8 in) film, and returned in a Satellite Recovery Vehicle. The Satellite Recovery Vehicle carried aboard Discoverer 22 was SRV-509. Discoverer 22 had a mass of 1150 kg (excluding propellants).
