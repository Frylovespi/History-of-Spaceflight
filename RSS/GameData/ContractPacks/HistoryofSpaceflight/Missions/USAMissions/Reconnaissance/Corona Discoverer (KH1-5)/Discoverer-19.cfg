	description = Discoverer 19, also known as RM-1, was an American satellite which was launched into a near polar orbit. It was a technology demonstration spacecraft, based on an Agena-B. It was part of the Corona program which was also used to produce maps and charts for the Department of Defense and other US government mapping programs. Discoverer 19 had a mass of 1,060 kg and did not carry a film canister. It was orbited to test radiation dosimeters, infrared radiometers, and microwave band detectors for the Midas missile detection system. It remained in orbit until 23 January 1961, when it decayed and reentered the atmosphere.
