	description = Discoverer 28, also known as Corona 9021, was an American optical reconnaissance satellite which was lost in a launch failure in 1961. It was the last KH-2 Corona satellite, which was based on an Agena-B. It failed to achieve orbit after the Agena's guidance and control system malfunctioned. Discoverer 28 was to have operated in a low Earth orbit. It was equipped with a panoramic camera with a focal length of 61 cm, which had a maximum resolution of 7.6 m. Images were to have been recorded onto 70-mm film, and returned in a Satellite Recovery Vehicle.\n\nThe Satellite Recovery Vehicle carried by Discoverer 28 was SRV-512. It had a mass of 1150 kg.
