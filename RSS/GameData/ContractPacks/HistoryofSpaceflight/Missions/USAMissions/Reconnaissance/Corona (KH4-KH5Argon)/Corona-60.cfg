	description = Corona 60 (KH-4 9052) was a Key Hole-4 reconnaissance satellite used by the United States. It acquired imagery intelligence by taking photographs and returning the undeveloped film to earth. From orbit, it achieved a typical ground-resolution of 7.5 m, and a frame coverage of 308 km x 308 km.&br;&br;The Film was designed to be returned by a single General Electric return vehicle (SRV, Satellite Return Vehicle). Liftoff of Corona 60 started normally, but shortly after it veered off course and had to be destroyed by range safety. Reports commissioned after suggest that the failure was in the new boosters deployed on the TAT Thor 2C354.

    notes = Launch the Corona 60 reconnaissance satellite and issue the Range Safety command shortly after takeoff.
