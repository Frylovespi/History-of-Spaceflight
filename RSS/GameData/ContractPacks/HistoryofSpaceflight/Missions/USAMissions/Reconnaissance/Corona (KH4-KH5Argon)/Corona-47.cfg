	description = Corona 47 (KH-4 9040) was a Key Hole-4 reconnaissance satellite used by the United States. It acquired imagery intelligence by taking photographs and returning the undeveloped film to earth. It achieved a typical ground-resolution of 7.5m and frame coverage of 308 km x 308 km. The Film was returned by a single General Electric return vehicle (SRV, Satellite Return Vehicle). The mission concluded four days after launch with the SRV successfully being air-captured on the return to Earth. Unfortunately the mission was a failure since there were no filters on the horizon cameras, causing heavy corona and radiation fog to be observed on the processed film.

	notes = Launch the Corona 47 reconnaissance satellite into a polar orbit and recover the film canister.
