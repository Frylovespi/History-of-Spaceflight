	description = Corona 56 (KH-4 9048) was a Key Hole-4 reconnaissance satellite used by the United States. It acquired imagery intelligence by taking photographs and returning the undeveloped film to earth. It achieved a typical ground-resolution of 7.5m and frame coverage of 308 km x 308 km. The Film was returned by a single General Electric return vehicle (SRV, Satellite Return Vehicle).
