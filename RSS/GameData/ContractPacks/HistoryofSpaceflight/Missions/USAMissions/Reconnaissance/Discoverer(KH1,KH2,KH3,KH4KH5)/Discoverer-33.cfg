    description = Discoverer 33, also known as Corona 9026, was an American optical reconnaissance satellite which was lost in a launch failure in 1961. It was a KH-3 Corona satellite, based on an Agena-B. The launch ended in failure after the Agena suffered a hydraulics system malfunction that led to premature main engine shutdown. Discoverer 33 was intended to have operated in a low Earth orbit and was equipped with a panoramic camera. It would have recorded images onto 70 mm film, and returned this in a Satellite Recovery Vehicle at the end of its mission. The Satellite Recovery Vehicle carried by Discoverer 33 was SRV-553. It had a mass of 1150 kg (excluding propellants).
