	description = Discoverer 48 (FTV1152) was a Key Hole-4 reconnaissance satellite used by the United States. It acquired imagery intelligence by taking photographs and returning the undeveloped film to earth. It achieved a typical ground-resolution of 7.5m and frame coverage of 308 km x 308 km. The Film was returned by a single General Electric return vehicle (SRV, Satellite Return Vehicle). The mission was successfully completed with the air capture of the SRV occurring four days after launch. Unfortunately the film sustained severe corona and radiation fog damage and very little useful intelligence was gained. 

	notes = Launch the Discoverer 48 reconnaissance satellite and recover the film canister after 4 days in orbit.
	synopsis = Discoverer 48 was launched on August 2, 1962 aboard a Thor-Agena D booster from Vandenberg AFB.
