	description = Discoverer 47 (FTV-1131) was a Key Hole-4 reconnaissance satellite used by the United States. It acquired imagery intelligence by taking photographs and returning the undeveloped film to earth. It achieved a typical ground-resolution of 7.5m and frame coverage of 308 km x 308 km. The Film was returned by a single General Electric return vehicle (SRV, Satellite Return Vehicle). The mission concluded four days after launch with the SRV successfully being air-captured on the return to Earth. Unfortunately the mission was a failure since there were no filters on the horizon cameras, causing heavy corona and radiation fog to be observed on the processed film.

	notes = Launch the Discoverer 47 reconnaissance satellite into orbit and recover the film canister. 
	synopsis = Discoverer 47 was launched on July 28, 1962 aboard a Thor-Agena B booster from Vandenberg AFB.
