	description = Discoverer 43 (FTV-1127) was a Key Hole-4 reconnaissance satellite used by the United States. It acquired imagery intelligence by taking photographs and returning the undeveloped film to earth. It achieved a typical ground-resolution of 7.5m and frame coverage of 308 km x 308 km. Launch and orbital insertion of Discovery 43 was nominal and the spacecraft recorded imagery over its four day orbit. However, the mission was a failure. During air catch, the chute tore loose and the capsule sank.
