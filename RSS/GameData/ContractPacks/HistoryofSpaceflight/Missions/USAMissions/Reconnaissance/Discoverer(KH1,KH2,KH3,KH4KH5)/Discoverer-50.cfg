	description = Discoverer 50 (FTV-1132) was a Key Hole-4 reconnaissance satellite used by the United States. It acquired imagery intelligence by taking photographs and returning the undeveloped film to earth. It achieved a typical ground-resolution of 7.5m and frame coverage of 308 km x 308 km. The Film was returned by a single General Electric return vehicle (SRV, Satellite Return Vehicle). The launch and orbital insertion went as planned and the corona satellite recorded images of its targets over its entire four days mission, but the mission was a failure when the parachute shrouds parted during air catch and the capsule sank.
