	description = Discoverer 57 (FTV-1156) was a Key Hole-4 reconnaissance satellite used by the United States. It acquired imagery intelligence by taking photographs and returning the undeveloped film to earth. It achieved a typical ground-resolution of 7.5m and frame coverage of 308 km x 308 km. The Film was returned by a single General Electric return vehicle (SRV, Satellite Return Vehicle). Its film canister was recovered 4.1 days after launch. Discoverer 57 was the best surveillance mission to date.
