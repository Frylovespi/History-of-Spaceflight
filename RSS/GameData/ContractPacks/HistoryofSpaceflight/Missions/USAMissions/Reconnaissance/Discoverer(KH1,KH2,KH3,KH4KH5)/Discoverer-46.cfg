	description = Discoverer 46 (FTV-1130) was a Key Hole-4 was a reconnaissance satellite used by the United States. It acquired imagery intelligence by taking photographs and returning the undeveloped film to earth. It achieved a typical ground-resolution of 7.5m and frame coverage of 308 km x 308 km. The Film was returned by a single General Electric return vehicle (SRV, Satellite Return Vehicle). The launch and orbital insertion of Discoverer 46 was successfully completed, but the mission was aborted after six orbits due to heavy corona and radiation fog.
