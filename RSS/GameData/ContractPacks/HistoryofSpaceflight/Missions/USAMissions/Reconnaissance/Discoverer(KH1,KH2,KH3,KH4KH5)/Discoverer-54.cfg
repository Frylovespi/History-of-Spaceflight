	description = Discoverer 54 (FTV-1136) was a Key Hole-4 reconnaissance satellite used by the United States. It acquired imagery intelligence by taking photographs and returning the undeveloped film to earth. It achieved a typical ground-resolution of 7.5m and frame coverage of 308 km x 308 km. The Film was returned by a single General Electric return vehicle (SRV, Satellite Return Vehicle). Particles and fields experiments were included on this satellite to study effects of high altitude nuclear explosions of the United States and the Soviet Union.
