	description =  Discoverer 12 was designed to develop and improve launching techniques, propulsion, communications, and orbital performance and to conduct advanced engineering tests, including separation, deceleration, reentry through the atmosphere, and recovery from the sea of an instrument package. The cylindrical Agena A stage carried a telemetry system, tape recorder, receivers for command signals from the ground, a horizon scanner, and a 136-kg package that included a recovery capsule with recovery aids, retrorockets, and telemetry equipment to measure its performance. The payload was identical to that of Discoverer 8, with the addition of a doppler beacon and external lights installed on the Agena A casing for tracking purposes. Discoverer 12 again failed to reach orbit, when the Agena-A attitude control failed.
