    description = Discoverer 30, also known as Corona 9022, was an American optical reconnaissance satellite which was a KH-3 Corona satellite, based on an Agena-B rocket. Its mission was to assess how rapidly the Soviet Union was producing long-range bombers and ballistic missiles, and where they were being deployed. It was part of the Corona program which was also used to produce maps and charts for the Department of Defense and other US government mapping programs. Discoverer 30 was equipped with a panoramic camera with a focal length of 61 cm, which had a maximum resolution of 7.6 m. Images were recorded onto 70 mm film, and returned in a Satellite Recovery Vehicle two days after launch. As with the previous mission, all of the images returned were found to be out of focus. The Satellite Recovery Vehicle used by Discoverer 30 was SRV-551. Once its images had been returned, Discoverer 30's mission was complete, and it remained in orbit until its decay on 11 December 1961. Discoverer 30 had a mass of 1150 kg.

	synopsis = Discoverer 30 was launched on September 12, 1961 aboard a Thor DM-21-Agena-B from the Vandenberg AFB Launch Complex.
