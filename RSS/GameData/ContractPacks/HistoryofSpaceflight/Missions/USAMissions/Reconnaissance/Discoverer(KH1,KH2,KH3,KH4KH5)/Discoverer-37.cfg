	description = Discoverer 37, also known as Corona 9030, was an American optical reconnaissance satellite which was lost in a launch failure in 1962. It was the last KH-3 Corona satellite, which was based on an Agena-B rocket. It failed to reach or bit due to a failure in the Agena engine. Discoverer 37 was intended to be operated in a low Earth orbit, and was equipped with a panoramic camera with a focal length of 61 cm, which had a maximum resolution of 7.6 meters. Images were to have been recorded onto 70 mm film, and returned in a Satellite Recovery Vehicle at the end of the mission. The Satellite Recovery Vehicle which was to have been used by Discoverer 37 was SRV-571.
