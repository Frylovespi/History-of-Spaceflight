	description = Discoverer 29 (1961 Psi) was a U.S. Air Force Ballistic Missile Division low altitude polar orbit reconnaissance satellite. The program objectives were to image suspected ballistic missile launch sites in the U.S.S.R, to test a system of better orbital control of the Agena B launch vehicle, and to collect scientific data concerning electrons, x-rays, and galactic RF radiation.&br;&br;Discoverer 29 was equipped with a panoramic camera with a focal length of 61 cm (24 in), which had a maximum resolution of 7.6 m. Images were recorded onto 70 mm film, and returned in a Satellite Recovery Vehicle two days after launch, however all of the images returned were found to be out of focus.&br;&br;The Satellite Recovery Vehicle used by Discoverer 29 was SRV-554 and had a mass of 1150 kg. Once its images had been returned, Discoverer 29 remained in orbit until it decayed in November 1969.
