	description = Discoverer 20 was a satellite placed in a near-polar orbit to continue evaluation of the Agena B system, with particular emphasis on the spacecraft's stabilization system in order to overcome instability problems encountered on previous Discoverers, and to attempt ejection, deceleration, reentry through the atmosphere, and recovery of an instrument package. The satellite's scientific experiment package of radiation dosimeters, infrared radiometers, and microwave band detectors was identical to that of Discoverer 18. Recovery of the capsule was not attempted due to a system malfunction, and thus the scientific experiment data obtained were limited. The recovery capsule payload had a mass of 1110 kg, and included photographic film packs, nuclear track plates, and biological specimens.
