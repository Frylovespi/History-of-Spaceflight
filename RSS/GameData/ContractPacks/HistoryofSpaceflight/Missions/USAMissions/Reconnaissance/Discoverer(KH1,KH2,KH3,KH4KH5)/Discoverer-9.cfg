	description = Discoverer 9 was a first generation, low resolution Air Force surveillance satellite launched from Vandenberg AFB aboard a Thor Agena-A rocket. The mission failed because the satellite never reached orbit. The Thor cut off 20 seconds early and left the Agena without sufficient velocity or attitude control. It began tumbling, sending the payload into the Pacific Ocean.        

	notes = Launch the Discoverer 9 reconnaissance satellite and fail to deploy the Agena.
