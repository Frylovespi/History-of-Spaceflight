	description = Discoverer 45 (FTV-1151) was a Key Hole-4 reconnaissance satellite used by the United States. It acquired imagery intelligence by taking photographs and returning the undeveloped film to earth. It achieved a typical ground-resolution of 7.5m and frame coverage of 308 km x 308 km. The Film was returned by a single General Electric return vehicle (SRV, Satellite Return Vehicle). Discoverer 45 launched successfully and recorded images over its four day orbit. The return capsule was successfully recovered, but the film contained severe corona static.
