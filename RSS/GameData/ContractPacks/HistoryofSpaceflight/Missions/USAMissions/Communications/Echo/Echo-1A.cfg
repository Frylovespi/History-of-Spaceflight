	description = The Echo 1 spacecraft was a 30.48-m-diameter balloon of mylar polyester film 0.5 mil (0.0127 mm) thick. The spacecraft was designed as a passive communications reflector for transcontinental and intercontinental telephone (voice), radio, and television signals. It had 107.9-MHz beacon transmitters for telemetry purposes. These transmitters were powered by five nickel-cadmium batteries that were charged by 70 solar cells mounted on the balloon. It had a mass of 66.0 kg.
