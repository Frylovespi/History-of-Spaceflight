	description = The Echo 2 spacecraft was a 256.0 kg, 41-m balloon of aluminum foil-Mylar laminate. Echo 2 was designed as a rigidized passive communications spacecraft for testing propagation, tracking, and communication techniques. Instrumentation included a beacon telemetry system that provided a tracking signal, monitored spacecraft skin temperature between -120 deg C and +16 deg C, and measured the internal pressure of the spacecraft between 5E-5 mm of mercury and 0.5 mm of mercury, especially during the initial inflation stages. This system, which consisted of two beacon assemblies, used solar cell panels for power and had a minimum power output of 45 mW at 136.17 MHz and 136.02 MHz. In addition to fulfilling its communications mission, the spacecraft was used for global geometric geodesy.&br;&br;Echo 2 was placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 1316 km, a perigee of 1029 km, an inclination of 81.5 degrees, and an orbital period of 108.95 minutes. The spacecraft decayed from orbit on June 7, 1969.
