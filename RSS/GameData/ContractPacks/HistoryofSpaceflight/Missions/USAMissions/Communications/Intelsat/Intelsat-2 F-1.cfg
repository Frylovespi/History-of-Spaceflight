    description = Intelsat 2 F-1, also known as Blue Bird, was a COMSAT Corporation commercial communications satellite. It was built by the Hughes Aircraft Company using the HS-303A Bus and had a planned 3 year operating life. The spacecraft carried two transponders providing a transpacific communications link for 240 telephone, or two television channels. It used a total of 85 watts of power provided by body-mounted solar panels. The launch and initial orbital insertion burn occured without problems. Unfortunately the apogee monitor malfunctioned and resulted in the spacecraft ending up in an elliptical orbit. This led to mission failure as the satellite was not usable for its intended purpose. Intelsat 2 F-1 had a total mass of 162.0 kg.
