	description = Intelsat 2 F-2, also known as Lani Bird, was a communications satellite operated by Intelsat. The second of four Intelsat 2 satellites to be launched, Intelsat 2 F-2 was built by Hughes Aircraft around the HS-303A satellite bus. It carried two transponders, which were powered by body-mounted solar cells generating 85 watts of power. The spacecraft had a mass of 162 kilograms at launch, decreasing to 86 kilograms by the beginning of its operational life. 

    notes = Launch the Intelsat 2 F-2 commercial communications satellite into a geosynchronous orbit.
    synopsis = <color=yellow>Intelsat-2B was launched on January 11, 1967 on a Thor-Delta E1 rocket from the Cape Canaveral Launch Complex.</color>
