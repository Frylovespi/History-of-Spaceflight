	description = Aurora 1 was a military research satellite built by Rice University for USAF STP (Space Test Program) It investigated the Aurora Borealis. Aurora 1 was designed and built entirely on the Rice University campus at the Satellite Techniques Lab. It had a mass of 21.0 kg. The satellite was successfully launched in June 1967 together with SECOR 9 on a Thor-LV2D Burner-2 with a Star-13A upper stage.&br;&br;SECOR 9 was an all-weather geodetic survey system which was in operational use for several years, establishing a global survey network. It used the successive positions of artificial satellites in space to determine locations on the earth's surface with exactness over long distances. The system consisted of a satellite and four ground stations.
