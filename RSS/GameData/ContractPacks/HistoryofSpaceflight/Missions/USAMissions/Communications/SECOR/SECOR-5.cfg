	description = SECOR 5 was a small geodetic satellite used to precisely determine points on the earth. It was launched by the WSMC as a joint venture of the US Army and Navy to locate Pacific islands. Experiments with these led to Timation, and finally to the GPS Navstar system. It had a mass of 18.0 kg.
