	description = Syncom 1 was designed to be the first test of a communication satellite in geosynchronous orbit. The objective of the mission was to put the satellite into a 24 hour orbit with an inclination of about 30 degrees over the Atlantic Ocean. After launch into a highly elliptical orbit on 14 February 1963, initial communication tests conducted from the USNS Kingsport off Nigeria were successful. About 5 hours after launch the apogee motor was commanded to fire to place the satellite into a near-synchronous orbit. At about the time the motor completed its 20 second burn all contact was lost. NASA officials assumed that "the satellite's spin axis was misaligned at the time of the apogee motor firing. Because of this they have been unable to determine whether the satellite is damaged." Attempts were made to communicate with the spacecraft but contact was never re-established. It had a mass of 39.0 kg.
