	description = Transit O-1, was a 60-kg navigation satellite, also know as the Navy Navigation Satellite (NNS). The Transit-O series, that closely followed the design of Transit 5C-1, were also called "Oscars" (the phonetic alphabet for "O"), i.e., Operational. NSS O-1 failed after a few days operation. The first NNS O satellites were built by the Naval Avionics Facility at Indianapolis but, after O-1 and O-2 failed to operate more than a few days, APL refurbished the following ones and built new ones. The Transit series was developed for updating the inertial navigation systems on board U.S. Navy Polaris submarines.&br;&br;Calsphere 1 & 2 were launched on the same rocket and put into similar orbits. These two Calsphere satellites were small passive satellites to measure the effects of atmospheric drag. Both spheres had the same geometric dimensions, but had a different mass. Calsphere 1 had a mass of only 0.9 kg, while Calsphere 2 had a mass of 9.5 kg.
