	description = Transit O-6 was a 50 kg US Navy navigation satellite. It carried a SNAP 9A nuclear power source. The Transit-O series of satellites that closely followed the design of Transit 5C-1 were also called “Oscars” (Oscar is the phonetic alphabet for “O”, i. e., operational). They were also called NNS (Navy Navigation Satellite) or shortened NavSat.
