	description = LES-2 (Lincoln Experimental Satellite 2) was a 31.0 kg US military communications satellite. It was identical to the already launched LES 1. It contained solid-state X-band radio equipment, low-power logic circuits, electronic de-spinning (using optics to determine the location of the Earth and Sun relative to a spinning satellite at any moment, and then transmitting via whichever of several antennae were best positioned with respect to the Earth), and magnetic torquers.&br;&br;LES 2 was placed in an elliptical medium Earth orbit with an apogee of 14,810 km, a perigee of 2,771 km, an inclination of 32.2 degrees.
