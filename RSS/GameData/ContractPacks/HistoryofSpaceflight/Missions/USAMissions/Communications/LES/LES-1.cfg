	description = LES 1 (Lincoln Experimental Satellite 1) was a 31.0 kg US military communications satellite. It contained solid-state X-band radio equipment, low-power logic circuits, electronic de-spinning (using optics to determine the location of the Earth and Sun relative to a spinning satellite at any moment, and then transmitting via whichever of several antennae were best positioned with respect to the Earth), and magnetic torquers. The initial program objective was to build, launch, and field a system to demonstrate practical military satellite communications. The availability of Project West Ford's advanced super high frequency (SHF) technology (at seven to eight gigahertz) contributed to the decision to design the system for that band. The Department of Defense's concurrent procurement of a series of SHF satellites and terminals, commencing with the Initial Defense Communications Satellite Program (IDCSP), meant that lessons learned from the experiments would find an additional application.&br;&br;LES 1 was placed in a near circular low Earth orbit with an apogee of 2809 km, a perigee of 2,783 km, an inclination of 32.1 degrees.
