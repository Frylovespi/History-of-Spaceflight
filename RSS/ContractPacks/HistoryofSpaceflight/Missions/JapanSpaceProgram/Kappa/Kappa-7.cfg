	description = The Kappa series represented Japan's first large post-war indigenously-developed sounding rockets. They led eventually to the Lambda and Mu solid rocket satellite launchers. The Kappa-7 was one of Japan's early sounding rockets and was designed as a booster for Japan's later Kappa-8 and Kappa-9 rockets. It was determined, however, that the vehicle was unsuitable as a single stage rocket. to confirm the motors suitability as a booster.Kappa-7 was a single stage vehicle consisting of 1 x Kappa-7 solid rocket booster. It had a thrust of 100.00 kN, a height of 8.7 m, a diameter of 0.42 m, and an apogee of 50 km. It was launched on November 18, 1959.
