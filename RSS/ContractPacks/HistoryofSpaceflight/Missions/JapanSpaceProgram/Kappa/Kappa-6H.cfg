	description = Kappa-6H was another one-off test flight that further developed Japan’s launch capabilities. Kappa-6H was a Two stage vehicle consisting of 1-K150 (19.0 kN, 0.25 m diameter) second stage SRB and 1 x K250-6H (34.0 kN, 0.35 m diameter) first stage SRB. It was designed to launch a grenade at apogee to study atmospheric winds. It had a height of 7.1 m, and had an apogee of 70 km. Kappa-6H was launched on September 29, 1960, at the Akita Rocket Range.
