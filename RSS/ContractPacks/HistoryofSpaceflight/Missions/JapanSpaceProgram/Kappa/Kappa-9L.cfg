	description = The Kappa series represented Japan's first large post-war indigenously-developed sounding rockets. They led eventually to the Lambda and Mu solid rocket satellite launchers. Kappa-9L was a three stage vehicle consisting of 1-K150 (19.0 kN, 0.15 m diameter) third stage SRB, 1-K250-6 (34.0 kN, 0.25 m diameter) second stage SRB, and 1K-420 (110.0 kN, 0.42 m diameter) first stage SRB. It had a height of 11.6 m, and could carry a payload of 25 kg to an altitude of 350 km. Kappa-9L was launched on December 1, 1960.
