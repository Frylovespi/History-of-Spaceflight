         description = The FR-1 spacecraft was a small spacecraft carrying two experiments. One was designed to observe VLF signals from earth-based transmitters, and the other was an electron density probe measuring electron concentration at the satellite. The satellite structure consisted of two truncated octagonal pyramids, joined at their bases by an octagonal prism measuring 68.6 cm across from corner to corner. This basic structure was covered with solar cells and measured about 71.2 cm high. It had a mass of 71.1 kg and was launched from a Scout rocket from Vandenberg AFB on December 6, 1965.
