	description = The first missile produced for China's space program was the Dongfeng 1 missile (DF-1). It was a licensed copy of the Soviet R-2 (SS-2 Sibling) short-range ballistic missile, which is a direct descendant of the German V-2. The DF-1 had a single RD-101 rocket engine, and used alcohol for fuel with liquid oxygen (LOX) as an oxidizer.\n\nThe DF-1 had a maximum range of 550km and carried a 500kg payload.
