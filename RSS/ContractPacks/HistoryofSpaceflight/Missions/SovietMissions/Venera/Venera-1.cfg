    description = Venera 1 (meaning Venus 1), also known as Venera-1VA No.2 and occasionally in the West as Sputnik 8 was the first spacecraft to fly past Venus, as part of the Soviet Union's Venera program. Launched in February 1961, it flew past Venus on 19 May of the same year; however, radio contact with the probe was lost before the flyby, resulting in it returning no data.\n\nVenera 1 was a 643.5 kg probe consisting of a cylindrical body 1.05 m in diameter topped by a dome, totaling 2.04 m in height. This was pressurized to 1.2 standard atmospheres (120 kPa) with dry nitrogen, with internal fans to maintain even distribution of heat. Two solar panels extended from the cylinder, charging a bank of silver-zinc batteries. A 2 m parabolic wire-mesh antenna was designed to send data from Venus to Earth on a frequency of 922.8 MHz. A 2.4 m antenna boom was used to transmit short-wave signals during the near-Earth phase of the mission.\n\nVenera-1 was launched on a Molniya 8K78 rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on February 12, 1961.
