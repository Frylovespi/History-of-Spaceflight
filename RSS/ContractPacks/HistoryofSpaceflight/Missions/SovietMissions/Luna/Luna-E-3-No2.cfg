         description = This early Luna launch was believed to be an attempt to reach the Moon and impact on its surface - the first attempt to reach the Moon surface. A Ye-1 probe was a simple craft: a pressurized spherical object made from aluminum-magnesium alloy, approximately the size of the first Sputnik, that carried five scientific instruments. The goals of the mission were to study the gas component of interplanetary matter (using the proton traps), meteoric particles and photons in cosmic radiation (using the piezoelectric detectors), the magnetic fields of the Moon and Earth (using the magnetometer), variations in cosmic ray intensity, and heavy nuclei in primary cosmic radiation. The probe (on its upper stage) also carried one kilogram of natrium to create an artificial comet on the outbound trajectory that could be photographed from Earth. During the launch, the booster developed longitudinal resonant vibrations on the strap-on boosters of the launch vehicle. The rocket eventually disintegrated at T+93 seconds, destroying its payload. Luna-E-3-No2 had a mass of 360 kg (including 3rd stage). It was launched on April 19, 1960 on a Luna-8K72 rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome launch site.
