         description = After the spectacular success of Luna 3, this Luna was to return more detailed photos of the lunar far side. The Ye-3 class vehicle was essentially a Ye-2A probe using a modified radio-telemetry system, but with the old Yenisey-2 imaging system. During the launch, the probe received insufficient velocity after premature third-stage engine cutoff. It reached an altitude of 200,000 kilometers and then fell back to Earth and burned up in Earthâ€™s atmosphere, much like some of the early American Pioneer probes. The launcher's third stage RO-5 engine either did not reach full thrust or shut down early. Luna E-1A No.1 was launched on April June 15, 1960 atop a Luna 8K72 carrier rocket.
