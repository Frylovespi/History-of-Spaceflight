         description = This mission was the third failure in a row in Soviet attempts to send a Ye-1 lunar impact probe to the Moon. The spacecraft was intended to release 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) of sodium, in order to create a cloud of the metal which could be observed from Earth, allowing the spacecraft to be tracked. The thrust level of the core engine of the R-7 booster dropped abruptly at 245 seconds into the flight, leading eventually to premature engine cutoff. The payload never reached escape velocity. It was launched on December 4, 1958 on a Luna-8K72 rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome launch site.
