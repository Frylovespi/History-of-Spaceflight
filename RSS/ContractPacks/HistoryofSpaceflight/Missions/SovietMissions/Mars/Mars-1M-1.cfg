	description = Mars-1M-1, designated Mars 1960A by NASA analysts and dubbed Marsnik 1 by the Western media, was the first spacecraft launched as part of the Soviet Union's Mars program, and the first attempt by humans to send spacecraft to the vicinity of Mars. Mars-1M-1 was the first of two Soviet Mars spacecraft intended to fly past Mars. (The Mars flyby was planned for 13 May 1961.) The 480-kg spacecraft initially included a TV imaging system and a spectro-reflectometer (to detect organic life on Mars), but mass constraints forced engineers to remove both instruments a week before launch. The mission profile called for the probe to first enter Earth orbit and then use a new fourth stage (called Blok L) to gain enough additional velocity to fly to a Mars encounter. During the launch, violent vibrations caused a gyroscope to malfunction. As a result, the booster began to veer from its planned attitude, the guidance system failing at 309 seconds, and the third-stage engine was shut down after the trajectory deviated to a pitch of greater than 7 degrees. The payload eventually burned up in Earth’s atmosphere over eastern Siberia. Mars-1M-1 was launched on a Molniya 8K78 rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on October 10, 1960.
