    description = Korabl-Sputnik 4 carried one dog, Chernushka, the human mannequin, Ivan Ivanovich, some mice, a guinea pig, and a television system and other scientific instruments. The flight lasted for a single orbit, and a successful recovery was made. It was the first successful flight of the new 'K' version of the Vostok rocket. This featured upgraded main and booster stage engines, as well as a new upper stage engine, the RD-109, that had improved thrust and efficiency over the RD-105 of the previous Vostok flight tests.
