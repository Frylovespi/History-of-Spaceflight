    description = Vostok 2, the second spacecraft in the U.S.S.R.'s manned flight series, was piloted by cosmonaut German S Titov. The spacecraft consisted of a nearly spherical cabin covered with ablative material. There were three small portholes and external radio antennas. Radios, a life support system, instrumentation, and an ejection seat were contained in the manned cabin. This cabin was attached to a service module that carried chemical batteries, orientation rockets, the main retro system, and added support equipment for the total system. This module was separated from the manned cabin on reentry. The spacecraft made 17 orbits of the earth in 25 hr and landed on August 7, 1961, in the Saratov region. Biomedical experiments were performed, and motion pictures of the earth were obtained during the flight.
