         description = Korabl-Sputnik 1 (meaning Ship Satellite 1, Boat Satellite 1, or Starship Satellite 1), also known as Sputnik 4 in the West, was the first test flight of the Soviet Vostok program, and the first Vostok spacecraft. It was launched on May 15, 1960. Though Korabl-Sputnik 1 was unmanned, it was a precursor to the first human spaceflight, Vostok 1. A bug in the guidance system had pointed the capsule in the wrong direction, so instead of dropping into the atmosphere the satellite moved into a higher orbit. The descent module re-entered the atmosphere on September 1, 1962. A piece was found in the middle of North 8th Street in Manitowoc, Wisconsin in the northern United States. The capsule had a mass of 1477.0 kg. It was launched on a Vostok-8K72 rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on May 15, 1960.
