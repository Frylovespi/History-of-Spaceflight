         description = This second flight test of the Vostok spaceship, and first launch failure, was totally unknown at the time, and  even a reference report like the Soviet Space Program 1971-75, published in 1976, had no knowledge of it. While having the old set of orientation systems, this spacecraft was far more advanced than its modest predecessor (Korabl Sputnik 1), since it was equipped with an operational life support system and a means of recovery. Two dogs, Chayka and Lisichka, were trained to fly into orbit on board. The test went awry right from the beginning: just nineteen seconds after launch, the booster began "to fork to one side" as a result of a fire and a breakdown of the combustion chamber in one of the strap-on engines (in Blok G). The inert strap-on broke away from the main vehicle, and the booster eventually exploded into pieces 28,5 seconds after lift-off. Although the descent apparatus separated from the stack, the explosion killed both passengers. It was launched atop a Vostok-8K72 rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome launch site on July 28, 1960.
