	description = The Sukhoi T-4, or "Aircraft 100", or "Project 100", or "Sotka" was a Soviet high-speed reconnaissance, anti-ship and strategic bomber aircraft that did not proceed beyond the prototype stage. It is sometimes called the Su-100. The T-4 had intake ramps similar to the XB-70, was made largely from titanium and stainless steel, and featured a quadruple redundant fly-by-wire control system but also employed a mechanical system as a backup. The aircraft's droop-nose lowered to provide visibility during takeoff and landing. A periscope was used for forward viewing when the nose was retracted, and could be employed at speeds of up to 600 km/h (373 mph).\n\nIt is believed to have reached at least Mach 1.3 at an altitude of 12,000 meters using four Kolesov RD36-41 engines. These engines each produced 157 kN thrust with afterburners. The aircraft was designed to achieve speeds of up to Mach 3.0 with 9 tons of weapons (two MKB Raduga Kh-45 missiles) under the wings, but the program was cancelled before the full performance of the aircraft could be reached.
	
	synopsis = Launch an airplane from the runway, fly between 10,000 m and 30,000 m, exceed 1097 m/s in level flight for 5 seconds, and then land back at the runway safely.
