	description = The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-19 (Russian: ?????? ? ??????? ???-19; NATO reporting name: Farmer) is a Soviet second generation, single-seat, twin jet-engined fighter aircraft. It was the first Soviet production aircraft capable of supersonic speeds in level flight. A comparable U.S. "Century Series" fighter was the North American F-100 Super Sabre, although the MiG-19 would primarily oppose the more modern McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II and Republic F-105 Thunderchief over North Vietnam.\n\nOn 20 April 1951, OKB-155 was given the order to develop the MiG-17 into a new fighter called "I-340", which was to be powered by two Mikulin AM-5 non-after-burning jet engines (a scaled-down version of the Mikulin AM-3) delivering 19.6 kN of thrust. The I-340 was supposed to attain 1,160 km/h (Mach 1) at 2,000 m, 1,090 km/h ((Mach 0.97) at 10,000 m, climb to 10,000 m in 2.9 minutes, and have a service ceiling of no less than 17,500 m.
	
	synopsis = Launch an airplane from the runway, fly between 10,000m and 20,000m, exceed 343 m/s in level flight for 5 seconds, and then land back at the runway safely.
