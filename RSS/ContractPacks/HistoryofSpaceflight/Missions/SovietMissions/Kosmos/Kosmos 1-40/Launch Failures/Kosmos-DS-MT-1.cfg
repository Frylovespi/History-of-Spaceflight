         description = Kosmos-DS-MT-1 was the first attempt to launch a DS-MT military test satellite atop a Kosmos-63S1 small launch vehicle. These battery powered satellites were to demonstrate an electric gyrodyne orientation system developed by VNIIEM. It also carried a scientific research package as a secondary payload, which was used to study cosmic rays and the luminosity of space. The booster didn't reach orbital velocity due to the failure in the first stage 4 seconds after lift off. The rocket fell back on to the pad causing major damage to the structure. It was launched atop a Kosmos-63S1 rocket from the Kapustin Yar launch site on June 1, 1963.
