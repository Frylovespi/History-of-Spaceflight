         description = Kosmos-Zenit-2-No14 was the twelfth attempt to launch a Zenit-2 reconnaissance satellite atop a Vostok launch vehicle. The basic design of the Zenit satellites was similar to the Vostok manned spacecraft, sharing the return and service modules. It consisted of a spherical re-entry capsule 2.3 meters (7.5 ft) in diameter with a mass of around 2,400 kilograms (5,300 lb). This capsule contained the camera system, its film, recovery beacons, parachutes and a destruct charge. The mission was a failure following launcherâ€™s block E upper stage malfunction. This Zenit spacecraft was liquidated by the auto-destruction system. It was launched atop a Vostok rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on November 28, 1963.
