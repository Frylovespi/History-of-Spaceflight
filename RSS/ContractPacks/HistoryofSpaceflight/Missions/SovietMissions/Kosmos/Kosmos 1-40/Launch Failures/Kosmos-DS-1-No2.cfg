    description = Kosmos-DS-1-No2 was the second attempt to launch a DS 1 technology test version of the DS satellite on a Kosmos-63S1 small launch vehicle.\n\nThe Kosmos 63S1 was a fraction of the cost to assemble and launch than the R-7's variants that the Soviet Union had launched in the past. It had a gross mass of just under 50,000 kg, a height of 31.0 m, and a diameter of 1.6 m. It could carry a 300 kg payload to 250 km orbit. The first stage RD-214 produced a thrust of 730.50 kN. The second stage RD-119 produced a thrust of 105.51 kN. The booster did not reach orbital velocity due to the failure in the second stage. The vehicle telemetry was abruptly lost at 353 seconds of flight.\n\nKosmos DS 1 No. 2 was launched on a Kosmos-63S1 rocket from the Kapustin Yar launch site on December 22, 1961.
