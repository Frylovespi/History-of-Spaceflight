         description = Kosmos-DS-1-No2 was the second attempt to launch a DS-1 technology test version of the DS satellite atop a Kosmos-63S1 small launch vehicle. The boster didn't reach orbital velocity due to the failure in the second stage. The vehicle telemetry was abruptly lost at 353 seconds of flight. It was launched atop a Kosmos-63S1 rocket from the Kasputin Yar launch site on December 22, 1961.
