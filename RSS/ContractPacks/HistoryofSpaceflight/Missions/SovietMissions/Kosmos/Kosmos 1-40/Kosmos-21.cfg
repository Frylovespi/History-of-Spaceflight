         description = Kosmos 21 was a 890-kg technological test of a new class of planetary probe. It was the first of the Soviet’s “third-generation” deep space probes of the 3MV series, designed to study Venus and Mars. This spacecraft was designed to verify key technological systems during a simple Moon flyby mission. It failed following the launcher’s fourth stages abnormally. After the craft had reached Earth orbit, ground control lost contact with the Blok L trans-lunar injection stage. Probably, the stage’s main engine turbopump exploded upon ignition, destroying the spacecraft, which decayed three days later. With this mission, the name Kosmos was given to Soviet spacecraft which remained in Earth orbit, regardless of whether or not that was their intended final destination. It was launched on a Molniya rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on November 11, 1963.
