         description = Marsnik-1 (also known as Korabl 4 and Mars 1960A) was reported by the NASA Administrator to Congress in 1962 to be an attempt at a Mars probe. Some Soviet scientists involved with the program at that time claim no knowledge of this mission, stating that only the launch on October 14 (Marsnik 2) was an intended Mars mission. However V.G. Perminov, the leading designer of planetary spacecraft at the Lavochkin design bureau, states that this mission was indeed intended for Mars, was identical to Marsnik 2. Marsnik-1 was launched from Baikanur Cosmodrome on October 10, 1960 on a Molniya-8K78 rocket.
