         description = Marsnik-2 (also known as Korabl 5 and Mars 1960B) was reported by the NASA Administrator to Congress in 1962 to be an attempt at a Mars probe. Some Soviet scientists involved with the program at that time claim no knowledge of this mission. The spacecraft was nearly identical to the Venera 1 design, a cylindrical body about 2 meters high with two solar panel wings, a 2.33 meter high-gain net antenna, and a long antenna arm, and had a mass of about 650 kg. It carried a 10 kg science payload consisting of a magnetometer on a boom, cosmic ray counter, plasma-ion trap, a radiometer, a micrometeorite detector, and a spectroreflectometer to study the CH band, a possible indicator of life on Mars. Marsnik-2 was launched from Baikanur Cosmodrome on October 14, 1960 on a Molniya-8K78 rocket.
