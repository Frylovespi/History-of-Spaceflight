    description = American short range ballistic missile. Experimental version of Corporal Missile. Nitric acid/Aniline-Furfuyrl alcohol propellants. The US Army ORDCIT program to develop ballistic rockets as potential weapons began with the Private-A and Private-F, continued with the Wac Corporal, and then the Corporal-E, before finally becoming a separate weapon development program. The first test flight of the Corporal-E was a complete success. The Corporal-E engine produced a thrust of 89.00 kN for 63 seconds. It had a mass of 4,500 kg, a height of 14.00 m, and a diameter of 0.76 m. It was designed to carry a 680 kg payload to an altitude 50 km, and reach a ground target up to 121 km away.
		 
	notes = The first Corporal-E flew on April 22, 1947 from the White Sands Missile Range.
