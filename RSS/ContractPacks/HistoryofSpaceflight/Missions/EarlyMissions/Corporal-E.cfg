         description = American short range ballistic missile. Experimental version of Corporal Missile. Nitric acid/Aniline-Furfuyrl alcohol propellants. The US Army ORDCIT program to develop ballistic rockets as potential weapons began with the Private-A and Private-F, continued with the Wac Corporal, and then the Corporal-E, before finally becoming a separate weapon development program. The first test flight of the Corporal-E was a complete success. The Corporal-E had a thrust of 89.00 kN, a height of 4.00 m, a diameter of 0.76 m, a mass of 4500 kg and a max apogee of 50 km. The first Corporal-E flew on April 22, 1947 from the White Sands Missile Range.
