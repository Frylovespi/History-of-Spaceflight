	description = American short range liquid-propellant ballistic missile. The first American operational guided missile, deployed 1954-1964. Replaced by the Sergeant solid-propellant missile. Development began under Project ORDCIT with a series of research rockets begun in 1944 (Private, WAC Corporal, Corporal E). Continued delays in the costly Hermes program led to a 1950 decision to cancel it and instead develop the Corporal into a tactical nuclear-armed ballistic missile. The W7 60 KT warhead was chosen for use on the Corporal. The MGM-5-Corporal's solid fuel engine produced a thrust of 89.20 kN for 63 seconds. It had a height of 14.02 m, a diameter of 0.76 m, a mass of 5440 kg, and could carry a 680 kg warhead to a downrange distance of 121 km.
		 
	notes = The MGM-5 Corporal was first launched on December 6, 1951 from the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico.
