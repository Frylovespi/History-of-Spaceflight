	description = The R-11 Zemlya, GRAU index 8A61 was a Soviet tactical ballistic missile. It is also known by its NATO reporting name SS-1 Scud-A. It was the first of several similar Soviet missiles to be given the reporting name Scud. It was the first Russian ballistic missile that used storable propellants. The R-11 originated from a 1951 requirement for a ballistic missile with similar performance to the German V-2 rocket, but half its size. With the Wasserfall, an anti-aircraft version of the V-2, as a model the R-11 was developed by engineer Victor Makeev, who was then working in OKB-1, headed by Sergey Korolev. The two men agreed on the use of RP-1 as the fuel, but disagreed over which oxidizer to use, with Korolev favoring the use of liquid oxygen, while Makeev advocated the use of a storable but toxic oxidizer. The R-11 had a mass of 5,337 kg, a height of 10.6 m, a diameter of 0.85 m, and could carry 400 kg payload to a max altitude of 160 km, with a range of 180 km.
	
	notes = The R-11 was first launched on April 18, 1953 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome Launch Complex.
