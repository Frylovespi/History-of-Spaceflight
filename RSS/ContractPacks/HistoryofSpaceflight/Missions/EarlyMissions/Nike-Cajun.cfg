         description = Nike-Cajun was an American sounding rocket. It was a two stage vehicle consisting of a Nike booster together with a Cajun upper stage. Aside from the Soviet MMR-06, the Nike-Cajun was the most often launched sounding rocket. The Cajun motor was developed for NASA in the 1950's by Thiokol, providing a more modern but still affordable replacement for the World War II-era Deacon. A total of 761 Nike-Cajun were launched until their retirement in 1976. It had a thrust of 246.0 kN, a height of 7.70 m, a diameter of 0.42 m, and an apogee of 120 km. It was first flown on July 6, 1956 from the Wallops Island launch site.
