	description = American sounding rocket (Atmospheric Sounding Projectile) originally designed against a US Navy Bureau of Ships requirement to sample the mushroom clouds of nuclear explosions. Developed by Cooper Development Corporation for the Naval Radiological Defense Laboratory. The single stage vehicle used the Grand Central Rocket motor developed to replace the Deacon, but which had lost the Air Force competition to the Thiokol Cajun. After tests at White Sands, two salvos of six rockets were fired during the Operation Redwing nuclear tests. The rocket would later be combined with a Nike first stage for upper atmosphere and solar research. It had a mass of 111 kg, and could carry a 13.6 kg payload to 40 km. The single stage engine produced a thrust of 42.0 kN. It had a height of 3.68 m, a diameter of 0.17 m, and a max altitude of 110 km.
