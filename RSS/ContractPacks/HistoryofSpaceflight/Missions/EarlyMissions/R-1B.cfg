         description = Stalin did not decide to proceed with Soviet production of this copy of the German V-2 until 1948. Despite the threatening supervision of the program by Stalin's secret police chief, Beria, and the assistance of German rocket engineers, it took eight years for the German technology to be absorbed and the missile to be put into service. It was almost immediately superseded by later designs, but the effort laid the groundwork for the Soviet rocket industry. Surplus R-1's were converted to use as a sounding rockets for military and scientific research missions. The Soviet versions also used their in home produced engine the RD-100 and gained valuable insights for their almost identical R-2 missiles which were being developed concurrently. The R-1B could carry a 483 kg payload to a maximum range of 270 km. It was first launched on September 17, 1948 from the Kapustin Yar Launch Complex.
