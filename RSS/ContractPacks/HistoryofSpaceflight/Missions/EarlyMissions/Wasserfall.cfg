         description = German storable propellant surface-to-air missile, tested during World War II, but never operational. The rocket was copied in the USA as the Hermes surface-to-surface missile, in the USSR as the R-101, and in France as the R.04. In Russia it also became the starting point for the R-11/R-17 Scud surface-to-surface missile. Work began on the Wasserfall missile in 1941, originally as an anti-aircraft version of the A4 surface-to-surface missile. On 25 September 1942 Goering authorized development of four types of surface to air missiles: unguided rockets (Taifun), target-seeking guided rockets (Enzian); operator optically-guided rockets (Rheintochter and Schmetterling); and radar-guided rockets (Wasserfall). A total of three Wasserfall's were launched before the program was canceled. It had a payload of 300 kg, a thrust of 78.0 kN, a height of 7.70 m, a diameter of 0.89 m, and burned for 40 s. It was first launched on February 29, 1944 from the Peenemuende Launch Site.
