    description = The Aggregat 4 (A-4) was a ballistic missile and was also known as the V-2 Rocket and Vergeltungswaffe 2. It was designed and developed by Wernher Von Braun in 1938, under the leadership of Dr. Walter Robert Dornberger, at the Army Research Center in Peenem√ºnde. The Aggregat 4 (A-4) ballistic missile was 14 m long by 1.65 m in diameter and had a takeoff weight 12,900 kg. The rocket engine used in the Aggregat 4 produced up to to 245.17 kN of thrust, which was a pressure fed system using 25% liquid oxygen and 75% ethanol, to give a maximum thrust of 245.17 kN for 68 seconds of burn time.
