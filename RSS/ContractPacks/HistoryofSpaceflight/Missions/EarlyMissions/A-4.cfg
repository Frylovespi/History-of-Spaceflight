    description = The Aggregat 4 (A-4) was a ballistic missile and was also known as the V-2 Rocket and Vergeltungswaffe 2 (Retribution Weapon 2). It was designed and developed by Wernher Von Braun in 1938, under the leadership of Dr. Walter Robert Dornberger, at the Army Research Center in Peenemunde. A series of prototypes culminated in the A-4, which went to war as the V-2. Beginning in September 1944, over 3,000 V-2s were launched by the German Wehrmacht against Allied targets, first London and later Antwerp and Liege. The attacks from V-2s resulted in the deaths of an estimated 9,000 civilians and military personnel, and a further 12,000 forced laborers and concentration camp prisoners died as a result of their forced participation in the production of the weapons. As Germany collapsed, teams from the Allied forces—the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union—raced to capture key German manufacturing sites and technology. Wernher von Braun and over 100 key V-2 personnel surrendered to the Americans. Eventually, many of the original V-2 team ended up working at the Redstone Arsenal. The US also captured enough V-2 hardware to build approximately 80 of the missiles. The Soviets gained possession of the V-2 manufacturing facilities after the war, re-established V-2 production, and moved it to the Soviet Union. The Aggregat 4 was 14 m long by 1.65 m in diameter, and had a takeoff weight 12,900 kg. The rocket engine used in the Aggregat 4 produced up to to 245.17 kN of thrust, which was a pressure fed system using 25% liquid oxygen and 75% ethanol, to give a maximum thrust of 245.17 kN for 68 seconds of burn time.
