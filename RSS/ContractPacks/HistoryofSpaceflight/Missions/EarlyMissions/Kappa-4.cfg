    description = The Kappa series represented Japan's first large post-war indigenously-developed sounding rockets. They led eventually to the Lambda and Mu solid rocket satellite launchers. Kappa-4 was a two stage vehicle consisting of a Kappa 4 Booster producing 105.0 kN thrust for 3 seconds, and a Kappa 4 second stage producing 10.0 kN of thrust for 3.0 seconds. It had a mass 650 kg, a height of 5.90 m, a diameter of 0.33 m, and an apogee of 80 km.
		 
	notes = Kappa 4 was first flown on September 20, 1957 at the Akita Rocket Range, Honshu Island, Japan.
