         description = The Kappa series represented Japan's first large post-war indigenously-developed sounding rockets. They led eventually to the Lambda and Mu solid rocket satellite launchers. Kappa-4 was a two stage vehicle consisting of 1 x Kappa 4 Booster + 1 x Kappa 4. It had a thrust of 105.00 kN, a height of 5.90 m, a diameter of 0.33 m, and an apogee of 80 km. It was first flown on September 20, 1957, at the Akita Rocket Range.
