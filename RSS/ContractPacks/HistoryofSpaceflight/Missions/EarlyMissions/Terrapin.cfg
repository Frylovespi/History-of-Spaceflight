         description = Terrapin sounding rockets were two-stage vehicles launched from Wallops Island. The Terrapin sounding rocket was developed by Republic Aviation under a National Security Agency contract for a University of Maryland project that allowed graduate students to study the upper atmosphere. The two-stage rocket used a Deacon motor with a slow-burn grain for the lower stage, and a TSI upper stage. The upper stage was equipped with low-drag swept stabilizing fins. It had a thrust of 15.0 kN, a height of 4.50 m, a diameter of 0.16 m, and an apogee of 130 km. It was first flown on September 21, 1956.
