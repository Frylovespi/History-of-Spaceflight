	description = The R-12 was a theater ballistic missile developed and deployed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Its GRAU designation was 8K63 (8K63U or 8K63Ð£ in Cyrillic for silo-launched version), and it was given the NATO reporting name of SS-4 Sandal. The R-12 was the first operationally effective intermediate range ballistic missile, the first Soviet missile deployed with a nuclear warhead, and the first mass-produced missile in history. The R-12 rocket provided the Soviet Union with the capability to attack targets at medium ranges with a megaton-class thermonuclear warhead, and constituted the bulk of the Soviet offensive missile threat to Western Europe. It was the primary deterrent threatening Western Europe and China throughout the Cold War. Deployments of the R-12 missile in Cuba caused the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. A total of 2335 missiles were produced; all were destroyed in 1993 under the Soviet and US Arms Control Treaty. The R-12 had a height of 22.1 m, a diameter of 1.65 m, and carried a payload of 390 kg to an altitude of 500 km, with a maximum range of 2000 km.
	
	notes = The R-12 was first launched on June 22, 1957 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome Launch Complex.
