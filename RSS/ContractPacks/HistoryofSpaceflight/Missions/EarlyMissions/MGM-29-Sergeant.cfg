         description = The MGM-29-Sergeant was an American single-stage solid-propulsion tactical ballistic missile developed for the US Army in 1956-1962. Surplus rockets and the Sergeant's rocket motor (known commercially as Castor) became the basis for many sounding rockets, test vehicles, stages for orbital launch vehicles, and lateral boosters for the Delta space launch vehicle. There were a total of 148 MGM-29-Sergeant launches before its retirement in 1994. It had a payload of 820 kg, a thrust of 200.0 kN, a height of 10.52 m, a diameter of 0.79 m, and an apogee of 80 km. It was first launched on January 19, 1956 from the White Sands Missile Range.
