	description = Viking was an early American sounding rocket. The Viking sounding rocket, originally code-named Neptune, was conceived in 1945 by the US Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) as having the same altitude capability as the V-2 but only one third the mass. Martin was given the contract to develop the rocket, and Reaction Motors the engine. The advanced design featured a gimbaled pump-fed engine, a fuel tank integral with the fuselage. All rockets would be static-tested and certified before launch. Viking was abandoned in 1954 as too expensive, but Martin's experience on the design led to the first stage of the Vanguard orbital launch vehicle and the Titan ICBM. There were 7 total launches of the Viking sounding rocket. It had a mass of 4,500 kg, a payload of 230 kg, a thrust of 93.00 kN, a height of 14.90 m, a diameter of 0.81 m, and a max apogee of 200 km.
		 
	notes = The first Viking launch was on May 3, 1949 at the White Sands Missile Complex in New Mexico.
