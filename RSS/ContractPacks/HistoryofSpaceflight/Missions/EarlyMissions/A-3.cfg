         description = After the success of the Aggregat-2 work began on the Aggregat-3 in 1935 and led again by Wernher Von Braun. The new facility in the Peenemünde area would be the new German testing grounds for their rockets. As with the previous Aggregats the A-3 was to be powered by a liquid oxygen and alcohol fuel mixture. The engine generated 14.7 kN of thrust for 45s. It used a three-gyroscope system to deflect tungsten alloy jet vanes for guidance. The A-3 had a length of 6.74m and a diameter or 0.68m. There were 2 launches on December 4 1937, and December 6, 1937. One of the missiles reached a downrange distance of 12 km and a max apogee of 18 km.
