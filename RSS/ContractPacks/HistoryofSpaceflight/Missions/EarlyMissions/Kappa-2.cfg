         description = The Kappa series represented Japan's first large post-war indigenously-developed sounding rockets. They led eventually to the Lambda and Mu solid rocket satellite launchers. Kappa-2 was a two stage vehicle consisting of 1 x Kappa 3 Booster + 1 x Kappa 1. It had a height of 5.00 m, a diameter of 0.22 m, and an apogee of 40 km. It was first flown on April 30, 1957, at the Akita Rocket Range.
