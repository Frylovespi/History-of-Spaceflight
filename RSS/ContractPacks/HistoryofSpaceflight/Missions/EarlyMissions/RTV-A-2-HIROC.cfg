	description = Among the various guided missile studies initiated by the U.S. Army Air Force in 1945 was Consolidated-Vultee's project MX-774, which was about supersonic surface-to-surface missiles. After the development contracts for cruise-type winged missiles went to Martin (MX-771, SSM-A-1/TM-61 Matador) and Northrop (MX-775, SSM-A-3/SM-62 Snark), Convair was awarded a contract to develop and test a ballistic research missile under project MX-774. The effort was named Hiroc (High-Altitude Rocket) and the vehicle received the designation RTV-A-2 in 1947. However, the program was formally canceled in June 1947, but Convair was allowed to complete and fly three test vehicles using available funds. The RTV-A-2 was powered by a Reaction Motors XLR35-RM-1 four-chamber liquid-fueled rocket motor that produced 35.5 kN of thrust, and had a cylindrical body with four fixed stabilizing fins. The Hiroc pioneered several new design techniques which would later be used in the SM-65/HGM-16 Atlas. It featured a gimbaled rocket nozzle to steer the vehicle by thrust-vectoring instead of weight- and drag-increasing control fins, and had a separable nose cone for the payload. The rocket had a length of 9.63m a diameter of 0.76m, a mass of 1860 kg and a max apogee of 65 km.
	
	notes = The first RTV-A-2 flew in July, 1948 from the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico.
