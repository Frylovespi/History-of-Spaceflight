         description = Pioneer 4 was a spin stabilized spacecraft launched on a lunar flyby trajectory and into a heliocentric orbit making it the first US probe to escape from the Earth's gravity. It carried a payload similar to Pioneer 3: a lunar radiation environment experiment using a Geiger-Mueller tube detector and a lunar photography experiment. It passed within 60,000 km of the Moon's surface. However, Pioneer 4 did not come close enough to trigger the photoelectric sensor. No lunar radiation was detected. The spacecraft was still in solar orbit as of 1969.
         
		 notes = Launch Pioneer-4 at the moon and end in a heliocentric orbit
		 synopsis = Pioneer-4 had a mass of 6.1 kg and was launched from a Juno II rocket from the Cape Canaveral launch site on March 3, 1959.
