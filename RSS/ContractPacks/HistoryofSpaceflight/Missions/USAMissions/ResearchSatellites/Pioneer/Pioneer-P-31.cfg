	description = Pioneer P-31 (Atlas-Able 5B) was intended to be a lunar orbiter probe, but the mission failed shortly after launch. The objectives were to place a highly instrumented probe in lunar orbit, to investigate the environment between the Earth and Moon, and to develop technology for controlling and maneuvering spacecraft from Earth. It was equipped to estimate the Moon's mass and topography of the poles, record the distribution and velocity of micrometeorites, and study radiation, magnetic fields, and low frequency electromagnetic waves in space. A mid-course propulsion system and injection rocket would have been the first U.S. self-contained propulsion system capable of operation many months after launch at great distances from Earth, and the first U.S. tests of maneuvering a satellite in space.\n\nThe vehicle exploded 68 seconds after launch due to a malfunction in the first stage. The payload fell into the Atlantic Ocean 12 to 20 km from Cape Canaveral in about 20 meter deep water.\n\nPioneer P-31 was almost identical to the earlier Pioneer P-3 satellite which failed, a 1-meter diameter sphere with a propulsion system mounted on the bottom giving a total length of 1.4 meters. Four solar panels, containing 2200 solar cells in 22 100-cell nodules, extended from the sides of the spherical shell in a "paddle-wheel" configuration with a total span of about 2.7 meters. The Pioneer-P30 probe had a mass of 175.5 kg, and was launched on an Atlas-Able-IV from the Cape Canaveral launch site on December 15, 1960.
