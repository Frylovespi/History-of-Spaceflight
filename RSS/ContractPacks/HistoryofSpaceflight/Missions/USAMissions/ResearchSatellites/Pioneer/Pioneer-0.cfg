         description = This spacecraft was the first U.S. attempt at a lunar mission and the first attempted lauch beyond Earth orbit by any country. The Pioneer 0 probe was designed to go into orbit around the Moon and carried a TV camera and other instruments as part of the first International Geophysical Year (IGY) science payload. The spacecraft was destroyed by an explosion of the first (Thor booster no. 127) stage 77 seconds after launch at 16 km altitude, 16 km downrange over the Atlantic. Failure was suspected to be due to a ruptured fuel or oxygen line or a faulty turbopump gearbox. It had a mass of 31.8 kg and was launched on a Thor-Able I rocket from the Cape Canaveral launch site on August 17, 1958.
