         description = Explorer 35 was a spin-stabilized spacecraft instrumented for interplanetary studies, at lunar distances, of the interplanetary plasma, magnetic field, energetic particles, and solar X rays. It was launched into an elliptical lunar orbit. The spin axis direction was nearly perpendicular to the ecliptic plane, and the spin rate was 25.6 rpm.  It had a mass of 230.0 kg and was launched from a Thor-Delta rocket from the Cape Canaveral launch site on July 19, 1967.
