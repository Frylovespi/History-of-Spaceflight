         description = Explorer 19 was the second in a series of 3.66-m inflatable spheres placed into orbit to determine atmospheric densities. Explorer 19 was launched while Explorer 9, the first satellite in the series, was still active, so that densities in two different portions of the atmosphere were sampled simultaneously. It had a mass of 7.7 kg and was launched from a Scout rocket from the Cape Canaveral launch site on December 19, 1963.
