    description = Explorer 13, also called S-55A, was injected into a geocentric orbit of moderate eccentricity using a Scout launch vehicle. The objectives of the flight were to test vehicle performance and guidance and to investigate the nature and effects of micrometeorites on the spacecraft systems. No penetrations were recorded by this satellite during experiment operations. The scientific instrumentation consisted of cadmium sulfide-cell, wire-grid, piezoelectric, pressurized-cell, and foil-type micrometeorite detectors. The orbit was lower than planned, and the spacecraft reentered the atmosphere on August 28, 1961, after only slightly more than 2 days in orbit.
	
	notes = Explorer 13 had a mass of 86.0 kg and was launched on a Scout-X1 from the Wallops Island launch site on August 28, 1961.
