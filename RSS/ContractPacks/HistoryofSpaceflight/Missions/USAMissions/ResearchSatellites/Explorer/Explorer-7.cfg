         description = Explorer 7 was designed to measure solar X-ray and Lyman-alpha flux, trapped energetic particles, and heavy primary cosmic rays (Z>5). Secondary objectives included collecting data on micrometeorite penetration and molecular sputtering and studying the earth-atmosphere heat balance. The spin-stabilized satellite's external structure consisted of two truncated conical fiberglass shells joined by a cylindrical aluminum center section. It had a mass of 41.5 kg. It launched atop a Juno-II rocket on October 13, 1959 from the Cape Canaveral launch site.
