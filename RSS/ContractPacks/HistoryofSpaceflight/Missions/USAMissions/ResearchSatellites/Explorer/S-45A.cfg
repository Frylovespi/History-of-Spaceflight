         description = Explorer (S-45A) was launched using a Juno 2 rocket. Its mission was to investigate the shape of the ionosphere. The second stage ignition system malfunctioned and the spacecraft did not achieve orbit. S-45A had a mass of 33.6 kg. It launched atop a Juno-II rocket on May 24, 1961 from the Cape Canaveral launch site.
