	description = Explorer 10 was a cylindrical, battery-powered spacecraft instrumented with two fluxgate magnetometers and one rubidium vapor magnetometer extending from the main spacecraft body, and a Faraday cup plasma probe. It was the first satellite to measure the "shock wave" generated by a solar flare. The mission objective was to investigate the magnetic fields and plasma as the spacecraft passed through the earth's magnetosphere and into cislunar space. The satellite was launched into a highly elliptical orbit. It had a mass of 35.0 kg.
	
	notes = Explorer 10 was launched on a Thor-Delta on March 25, 1961 from the Cape Canaveral Launch Complex.
