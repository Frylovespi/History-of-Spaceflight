    description = Explorer 12 was a spin-stabilized, solar-cell-powered spacecraft instrumented to measure cosmic-ray particles, trapped particles, solar wind protons, and magnetospheric and interplanetary magnetic fields. It was the first of the S 3 series of spacecraft, which also included Explorers 14, 15, and 26.\n\nThe spacecraft functioned well until December 6, 1961, when it ceased transmitting data apparently as a result of failures in the power system. Good data were recorded for approximately 90% of the active lifetime of the spacecraft. Explorer-12 had a mass of 37.6 kg and was launched on a Thor-Delta rocket from the Cape Canaveral Launch Complex on August 16, 1961.
