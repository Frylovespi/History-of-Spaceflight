	description = Vanguard Satellite Launch Vehicle Six (SLV-6) hoped to be the third successful flight of the American Vanguard rocket following the successful Vanguard 2 satellite on rocket Vanguard SLV-4. It was launched from Launch Complex 18A at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The second stage helium control bottle valve failed to open properly at engine start. Tank and chamber pressures rapidly decayed during second stage burn, and 40 seconds after engine start, the helium bottle ruptured due to pressure buildup. The third stage then separated and ignited, driving itself and the satellite into the Atlantic Ocean 300 miles downrange.
    
	notes = Launch the Vanguard-SLV-6 and suffer an engine failure 40 seconds after second stage ignition.
	synopsis = Vanguard-SLV-6 was launched on June 22, 1959 at the Atlantic Missile Range in Cape Canaveral, Florida.
