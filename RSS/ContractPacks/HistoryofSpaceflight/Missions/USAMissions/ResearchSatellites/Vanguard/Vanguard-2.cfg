         description = Vanguard 2 (1959 Alpha 1) was an Earth-orbiting satellite designed to measure cloud-cover distribution over the daylight portion of its orbit. It was the second successful Vanguard launch to orbit and the first operational weather satellite. The program objectives were to measure sunlight reflected from cloud cover and from the Earth's surface. The purpose of the IGY Vanguard satellite program, run by the U.S. Navy, was to launch one or more satellites into Earth orbit during the International Geophysical Year (IGY). Vanguard 2 launched aboard a Vanguard-SLV4 rocket on 17 February 1959 from the Atlantic Missile Range in Cape Canaveral Florida.
