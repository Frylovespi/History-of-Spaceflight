         description = Vanguard Satellite Launching Vehicle 3 (SLV-3) was launched on 26 September 1958. The second stage failed to achieve the minimal performance necessary to maintain Earth orbit, and the spacecraft re-entered the atmosphere and burned up. The objective of the satellite was to scan Earth's cloud cover from orbit. The purpose of the IGY Vanguard satellite program, run by the U.S. Navy, was to launch one or more satellites into Earth orbit during the International Geophysical Year (IGY). Vanguard-SLV-3 was launched on September 26, 1958 at the Atlantic Missile Range in Cape Canaveral, Florida.
