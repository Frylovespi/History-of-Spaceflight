	description = Ranger 2 was a flight test of the Ranger spacecraft system designed for future lunar and interplanetary missions. Ranger 2 was designed to test various systems for future exploration and to conduct scientific observations of cosmic rays, magnetic fields, radiation, dust particles, and a possible hydrogen gas "tail" trailing the Earth.\n\nThe spacecraft was launched into a low earth parking orbit, but an inoperative roll gyro prevented Agena restart. The spacecraft could not be put into its planned deep-space trajectory, resulting in Ranger 2 being stranded in low earth orbit upon separation from the Agena stage. The orbit decayed and the spacecraft reentered Earth's atmosphere on 20 November 1961.\n\nRanger 2 had a mass of 306.2 kg. It launched on an Atlas-Agena B rocket on November 18, 1961 from the Cape Canaveral Launch Complex.
