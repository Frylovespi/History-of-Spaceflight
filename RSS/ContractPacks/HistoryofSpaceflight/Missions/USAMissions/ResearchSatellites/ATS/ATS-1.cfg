         description = ATS 1 (Applications Technology Satellite) was designed and launched for the purpose of (1) testing new concepts in spacecraft design, propulsion, and stabilization, (2) collecting high-quality cloudcover pictures and relaying processed meteorological data via an earth-synchronous satellite, (3) providing in situ measurements of the aerospace environment, and (4) testing improved communication systems. The spin-stabilized spacecraft was cylindrically shaped and measured 135 cm long and 142 cm in diameter. It had a mass of 352.0 kg and was launched from an Atlas-Agena D rocket from the Cape Canaveral launch site on December 7, 1966.
