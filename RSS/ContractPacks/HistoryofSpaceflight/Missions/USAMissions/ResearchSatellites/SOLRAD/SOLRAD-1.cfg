	description = SOLRAD 1 was the public designation for a combination surveillance and solar X-Ray and ultraviolet scientific satellite. It was a  spin-stabilized spacecraft consisting of a sphere of 51 cm diameter and a mass of 91. kg. The spacecraft carried two Lyman-alpha photometers and one X-ray photometer mounted along the equator of the satellite, looking out in a direction parallel to its equatorial plane. A visible light aspect system that used a vacuum photocell to determine the solar aspect angle was also attached. The aspect system had the same direction of view as the UV photometers and the opposite view with respect to the X-ray photometer. The scientific objective of the project was to make long-term continuous observations of the solar hydrogen Lyman-alpha and soft X-ray emissions and to correlate these emissions with ground-based observations. The SOLRAD scientific package aboard the satellite provided cover for the GRAB (Galactic Radiation and Background) electronic surveillance package, the mission of which was to map the Soviet Union's air defense radar network.  SOLRAD 1/GRAB 1 had a mass of 91.0 kg.
