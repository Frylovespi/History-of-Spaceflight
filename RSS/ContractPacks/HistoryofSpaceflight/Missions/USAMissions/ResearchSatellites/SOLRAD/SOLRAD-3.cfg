         description = The SOLRAD 3 spin-stabilized spacecraft was a sphere of 51 cm diameter. The spacecraft carried two Lyman-alpha photometers and one X-ray photometer mounted along the equator of the satellite, looking out in a direction parallel to its equatorial plane. A visible light aspect system that used a vacuum photocell to determine the solar aspect angle was also attached. The aspect system had the same direction of view as the UV photometers and the opposite view with respect to the X-ray photometer. The objective of the project was to make long-term continuous observations of the solar hydrogen Lyman-alpha and soft X-ray emissions and to correlate these emissions with ground-based observations. The small ELINT satellite Grab-3, and magnetic research satellite injun-1 were also part of the payload of SOLRAD-3. They were deployed into orbit at the same time as SOLRAD-3. SOLRAD-3 had a mass of 91.0 kg, Injun-1 had a mass of 19.0 kg, and Grab-3 had a mass of 18.0 kg and were launched on an Thor-Able from the Cape Canaveral launch site on June 29, 1961.
