    description = SOLRAD 2 was an American series of satellites sponsored by the US Navy in a program to continuously monitor the Sun. SOLRAD was Satellite Techniques' first major project and NRL's first post-Vanguard satellite. This mission was to have been the second of a series intended to monitor solar radiation, primarily in the soft x-ray range of the spectrum. This mission failed because of a launch malfunction. The GRAB 2 ELINT satellite was also launched as part of the payload of SOLRAD 2. GRAB's receivers were used to catalog the waveforms and pulse repetition frequencies of Soviet air defense radars. GRAB 2 also did not survive or reach orbit. SOLRAD 2 had a mass of 91.0 kg and GRAB 2 had a mass of 18.0 kg.
