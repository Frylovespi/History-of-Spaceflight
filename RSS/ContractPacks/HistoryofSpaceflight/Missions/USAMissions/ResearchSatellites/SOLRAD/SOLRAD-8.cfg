         description = The NRL SOLRAD 8 satellite was one of the SOLRAD series that began in 1960 to provide continuous coverage of solar radiation with a set of standard photometers. SOLRAD 8 was a spin-stabilized satellite oriented with its spin axis perpendicular to the sun-satellite line so that the 14 solar X-ray and ultraviolet photometers pointing radially outward from its equatorial belt viewed the sun with each revolution. It had a mass of 59.0 kg and was launched from a Scout rocket from the Wallops Island launch site on November 19, 1965.
