         description = The 1965-16D satellite, the seventh satellite of the SOLRAD series, was launched from Wallops Island on January 11, 1965. This NRL satellite was spherical and, when measurements were obtained, it rotated around the spin axis at the speed of 1-2 turns per second. The satellite was not spin-stabilized, and two suitably designed photocells gave the necessary information about the solar aspect angle, i.e., the angle between the equatorial plane and the direction from the sun to the satellite. This satellite was instrumented to detect the solar X-ray emission and telemetered daily at Arcetri. It had a mass of 39.0 kg and was launched from a Thorad-Agena D rocket from the Vandenberg AFB launch site on March 9, 1965.
