         description = The Gravity Gradient Stabilization Experiment (GGSE-1) was a technology satellite launched by the US military from Vandenberg AFB aboard a Thor rocket. This was the first in the series that developed designs and deployment techniques later applied to the NOSS/Whitecloud reconnaissance satellites. It had a mass of 39.0 kg and was launched from a Thorad-Agena D rocket from the Vandenberg AFB launch site on November 11, 1964.
