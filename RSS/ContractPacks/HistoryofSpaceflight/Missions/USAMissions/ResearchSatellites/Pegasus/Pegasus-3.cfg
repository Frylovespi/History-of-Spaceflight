         description = The mission of this spacecraft was to measure meteoroid abundances over the mass range 10E-7 to 10E-4 g in the region near the earth. In its stored position with panels folded inside the Apollo service module, the spacecraft was 5.3-m high, 2.1-m wide, and 28-cm deep. The spacecraft was equipped with winglike appendages that extended to form a plane 29.3-m long by 4.3-m wide. These wings carried sensitive penetration surfaces for the experiments. It had a mass of 1451.5 kg and was launched from a Saturn-1 rocket from the Cape Canaveral launch site on July 30, 1965.
