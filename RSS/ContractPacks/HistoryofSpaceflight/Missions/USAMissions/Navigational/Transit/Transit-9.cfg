         description = Transit 9 was a US Navy navigation satellite. It carried a SNAP-9A nuclear power source. Transit, one of the first operational satellite systems, was also known as the Navy Navigation Satellite (NNS). Individual Transit satellites operated for over 10 years. Technical break- throughs during the program included gravity gradient stabilization, the use of radio-isotope thermoelectric generators (RTG), and navigation satellite technologies later used in the GPS system. Transit was superseded by the Navstar global positioning system. The use of the satellites for navigation was discontinued at the end of 1996 but the satellites continued transmitting and became the Navy Ionospheric Monitoring System (NIMS). It was launched from a Scout-X4 rocket from the Vandenberg AFB launch site on December 13, 1964.
