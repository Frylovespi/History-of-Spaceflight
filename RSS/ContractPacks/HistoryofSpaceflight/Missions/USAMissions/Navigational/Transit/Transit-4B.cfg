    description = Transit 4B was a US Navy navigation satellite. It carried a SNAP-3 nuclear power source. Transit, one of the first operational satellite systems, was also known as the Navy Navigation Satellite (NNS). The Transit spacecraft were developed for updating the inertial navigation systems on board US Navy Polaris submarines, and later for civilian use. Transit receivers used the known characteristics of the satellite's orbit, measured the Doppler shift of the satellite's radio signal, and thereby calculated the receivers position on the earth.\n\nAs a single spacecraft traveled overhead, the user measured the Doppler shift over a 15 minute period by receiving timing marks and satellite orbital information on two separate frequencies, 149.99 and 399.97 MHz. These signals were corrected for ionospheric refraction and the information was then fed into the users navigation system.\n\nThe payload also contained an extra hitchhiker satellite. The Transit Research and Attitude Control (TRAAC) satellite was launched by the US Navy along with Transit 4B. It was used to test the feasibility of using the earth's gravitational attraction to orient and stabilize a vehicle in space.\n\nTRAAC had a mass of 109.0 kg and Transit-4B had a mass of 79.0 kg. They were launched aboard a Thor-Ablestar rocket from the Cape Canaveral Launch Complex on November 15, 1961.
