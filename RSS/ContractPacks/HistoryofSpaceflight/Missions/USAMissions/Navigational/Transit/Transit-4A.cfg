    description = Transit 4A was a relatively small spacecraft. It was launched with two other spacecraft from the same launch vehicle. Its shape was nearly cylindrical (22-faced right prisms plus a base and top), 109 cm in diameter, and 79 cm in height. Most of the spacecraft surfaces were covered with solar cells for use with nickel-cadmium batteries. The primary mission was to serve as one of four operational navigational satellites for use by ships and aircraft. In addition, Transit 4A carried a SNAP-3 nuclear power source for testing, ELINT satellite Grab-3, and magnetic research satellite Injun-1.
	
	notes = Transit 4A had a mass of 79.0 kg, Injun-1 had a mass of 19.0 kg, and Greb-3 had a mass of 18.0 kg. They were launched on a Thor-Ablestar rocket from the Cape Canaveral Launch Complex on June 29, 1961.
