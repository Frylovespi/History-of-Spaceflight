         description = Discoverer 14 was a low resolution photo surveillance spacecraft launched by the US Air Force. Over Alaska on the 17th pass around the earth, the Agena ejected Discoverer 14 from its nose and retrorockets attached to the reentry vehicle fired to slow it for the return from orbit. After Discoverer 14 reentered the atmosphere, it released a parachute and floated earthward. It was launched into a polar orbit by a Thor-Agena B booster from Vandenberg AFB on August 18, 1960.
