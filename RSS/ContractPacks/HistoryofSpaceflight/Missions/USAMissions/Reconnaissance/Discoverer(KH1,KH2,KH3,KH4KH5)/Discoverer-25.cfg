         description = Discoverer 25 was launched by the U.S. Air Force Ballistic Missile Division (AFBMD) as part of a program to evaluate spacecraft design changes and to provide a stable platform for developing and testing various space experiments. The spacecraft carried instrumentation on board to measure cosmic radiation, atmospheric pressure, and micrometeoroid impacts. The spacecraft also contained samples of both rare earth and common metals in order to study the effects of cosmic radiation on various materials. It was launched on June 16, 1961 aboard a Thor DM-21-Agena-B booster from Vandenberg AFB.
