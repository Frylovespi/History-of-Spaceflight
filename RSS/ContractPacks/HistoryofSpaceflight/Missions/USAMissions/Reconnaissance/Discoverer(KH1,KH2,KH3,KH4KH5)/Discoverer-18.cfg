	description = Discoverer 18, also known as Corona-9013, was an American optical reconnaissance satellite placed in a near-polar orbit.  It was a KH-2 Corona satellite, based on an Agena-B. Its primary objectives were to test spacecraft engineering techniques, to continue evaluation of the Agena B vehicle, and to attempt separation, deceleration, reentry through the atmosphere, and recovery from the air of an instrument package. The satellite's scientific experiment package of radiation dosimeters, infrared radiometers, and microwave band detectors was identical to that of Discoverer 17. The satellite had a mass of 1,240 kg, and was equipped with a panoramic camera with a focal length of 61 cm, which had a maximum resolution of 7.6 m. Images were recorded onto 70-mm film, and returned in a Satellite Recovery Vehicle, which was recovered three days after the launch. The recovery capsule was ejected, reentered the atmosphere, and was retrieved in mid-air near Hawaii by a C-119 aircraft at around 14,000 ft altitude.
	
	notes = Discoverer-18 was launched from Vandenberg AFB aboard a Thor DM-21-Agena-B booster on December 7, 1960.
