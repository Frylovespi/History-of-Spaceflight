	description = Discoverer 31, also known as Corona 9024, was an American optical reconnaissance satellite which was a KH-3 Corona satellite, based on an Agena-B. Its purpose was to assess how rapidly the Soviet Union was producing long-range bombers and ballistic missiles, and where they were being deployed. It was part of the Corona program which was also used to produce maps and charts for the Department of Defense and other US government mapping programs.\n\nDiscoverer 31 was equipped with a panoramic camera with a focal length of 61 cm, which had a maximum resolution of 7.6 m. Images were recorded onto 70 mm film, but during the spacecraft's thirty-third orbit, the attitude control and power systems malfunctioned, and as a result Discoverer 31 was unable to complete its mission or return images.\n\nThe Agena-B decayed from orbit on 26 October 1961. Discoverer 31 had a mass of 1150 kg, and was launched on September 17, 1961 aboard a Thor DM-21-Agena-B from the Vandenberg AFB Launch Complex.
