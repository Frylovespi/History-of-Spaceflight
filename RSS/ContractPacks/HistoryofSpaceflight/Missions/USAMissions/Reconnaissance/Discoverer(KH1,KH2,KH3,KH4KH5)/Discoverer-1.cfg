	description = Discoverer 1 was the first of a series of satellites which were part of the Corona reconnaissance satellite program. It was launched on a Thor-Agena A rocket on February 28, 1959 at 1:49 PST from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. It was a prototype of the KH-1 satellite, but did not contain either a camera or a film capsule. It was the first satellite launched toward the South Pole in an attempt to achieve polar orbit, but was unsuccessful. A CIA report, later declassified, concluded that "Today, most people believe the DISCOVERER I landed somewhere near the South Pole." 

	notes = Launch the Discoverer-1 satellite and fail to reach a polar orbit.
	synopsis = Discoverer-1 had a mass of 783 kg, and was launched on a Thor-Agena A rocket on February 28, 1959 from the Vandenberg AFB launch site.
