         description = Discoverer 19 was a USAF photographic surveillance satellite designed to assess how rapidly the Soviet Union was producing long-range bombers and ballistic missiles, and where they were being deployed. It was part of the Corona program which was also used to produce maps and charts for the Department of Defense and other US government mapping programs. Discoverer 19 did not carry a film capsule. It was orbited as a test for the Midas missile-detection system. It was launched on December 20, 1960 aboard a Thor DM-21-Agena-B booster from Vandenberg AFB.
