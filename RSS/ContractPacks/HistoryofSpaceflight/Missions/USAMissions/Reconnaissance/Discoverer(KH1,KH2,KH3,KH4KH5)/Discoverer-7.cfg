	description = The Discoverer 7 spacecraft consisted of a main satellite body and a separable reentry vehicle containing a recovery capsule. It was designed to test launching techniques, propulsion, communications, orbital performance, engineering, and recovery techniques. The spacecraft was put into a near-polar orbit by the Thor-Agena A booster, but the power supply inverter providing electricity to the control system did not operate correctly, and Discoverer 7 began tumbling after launch. The reentry vehicle failed to separate from the spacecraft. 
         
	notes = Discoverer 7 had a mass of 783 kg and was launched on a Thor-Agena A rocket on November 7, 1959 from the Vandenberg AFB launch site.
	synopsis = Launch the Discoverer-7 reconnaissance satellite into orbit but do not attempt capsule recovery.
