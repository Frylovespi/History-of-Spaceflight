         description = Discoverer 13 was an Earth-orbiting satellite designed to test spacecraft engineering techniques and to attempt deceleration, reentry through the atmosphere, and recovery from the sea of an instrument package. It represented the first-ever successful recovery of an object from orbit. The cylindrical Agena A stage that was placed in orbit carried a telemetry system, a tape recorder, receivers for command signals from the ground, a horizon scanner, and a 120-lb recovery capsule that contained an American flag. The capsule splashed down in the Pacific Ocean 610 km NNW of Honolulu. The Haiti Victory, a Navy ship, sent out a helicopter which dropped frogmen into the water to attach a collar to the capsule for helicopter retrieval. It was brought back to the ship and taken to Pearl Harbor. The flag was presented to President Eisenhower on 15 August 1960. Discoverer-13 was launched from Vandenberg AFB aboard a Thor-Agena A booster on August 10, 1960.
