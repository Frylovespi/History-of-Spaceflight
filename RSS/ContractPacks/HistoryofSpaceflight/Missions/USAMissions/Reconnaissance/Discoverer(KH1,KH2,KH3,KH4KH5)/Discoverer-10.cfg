         description = Discoverer 10 was a first generation, low resolution Air Force surveillance satellite launched from Vandenberg AFB aboard a Thor Agena-A rocket. The booster began exhibiting abnormal pitch oscillations almost immediately at liftoff and Range Safety sent the destruct command at T+52 seconds when allowable safety margins were exceeded. It had a mass of 783 kg (excluding propellants) and was launched on a Thor-Agena A rocket on February 19, 1960 from the Vandenberg AFB launch site.
