	description = Discoverer 52 (FTV-1154) was a Key Hole-4 reconnaissance satellite used by the United States. It acquired imagery intelligence by taking photographs and returning the undeveloped film to earth. It achieved a typical ground-resolution of 7.5m and frame coverage of 308 km x 308 km. The Film was returned by a single General Electric return vehicle (SRV, Satellite Return Vehicle). This was the first use of a stellar camera. The film quality was not good due to erratic vehicle attitude and numerous light leaks. 

	notes = Launch the Discoverer 52 reconnaissance satellite and recover the film canister.
