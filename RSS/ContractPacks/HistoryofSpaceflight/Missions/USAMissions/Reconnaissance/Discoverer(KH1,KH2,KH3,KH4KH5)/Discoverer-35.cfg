	description = Discoverer 35, also known as Corona 9028, was an American optical reconnaissance satellite which was a KH-3 Corona satellite, based on an Agena-B. The mission objectives were to evaluate refinements in design changes to prior spacecraft. The spacecraft was also one of a series used by the USAF for low resolution photo surveillance. Special measuring devices were on board to telemeter voltages, pressures, and other performance factors in addition to normal telemetry equipment. Discoverer 35 was equipped with a panoramic camera with a focal length of 61 cm, which had a maximum resolution of 7.6 m. Images were recorded onto 70 mm film, and returned in a Satellite Recovery Vehicle, which was deorbited one day after launch. The Satellite Recovery Vehicle used by Discoverer 32 was SRV-523. The reentry capsule was ejected after one day in orbit and was recovered in mid-air by a C-130 aircraft at 13,000 ft.
	
	notes = Discoverer 35 was launched on November 15, 1961 aboard a Thor-Agena-B from the Vandenberg AFB Launch Complex.
