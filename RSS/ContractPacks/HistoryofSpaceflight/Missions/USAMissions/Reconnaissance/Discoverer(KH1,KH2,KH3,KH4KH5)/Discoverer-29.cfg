         description = Discoverer 29 (1961 Psi) was a U.S. Air Force Ballistic Missile Division low altitude polar orbit (apogee 345 miles, perigee 140 miles, inclination 82.1 deg) probe with an orbit period of 91.6 min. The program objectives were to test a system of better orbital control of the Agena B launch vehicle and to collect scientific data concerning electrons, x-rays, and galactic RF radiation. In addition, several biological specimens were exposed to the environment of space while making 33 orbits of the earth. It was launched on August 30, 1961 aboard a Thor DM-21-Agena-B booster from Vandenberg AFB.
