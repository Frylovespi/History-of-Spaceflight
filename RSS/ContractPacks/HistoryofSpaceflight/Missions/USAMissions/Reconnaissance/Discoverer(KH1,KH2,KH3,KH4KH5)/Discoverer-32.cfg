         description = Discoverer 32 was a satellite of the USAF Space Systems Division. Its purposes were to obtain better orbital control of the Agena B spacecraft, to study the effectiveness of various metals in radiation shielding, to determine electron and ion density, and to study erosion. It had a beacon transmitter and a SECOR (SEquentail COllation of Range) experiment. It was launched on October 13, 1961 aboard a Thor DM-21-Agena-B booster from Vandenberg AFB.
