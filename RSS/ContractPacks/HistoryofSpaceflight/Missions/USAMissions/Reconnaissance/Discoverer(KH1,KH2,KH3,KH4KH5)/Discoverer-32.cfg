    description = Discoverer 32 was a satellite of the USAF Space Systems Division. Its primary mission was for photographic reconnaissance of the Soviet Union. Its secondary mission was to obtain better orbital control of the Agena B spacecraft, to study the effectiveness of various metals in radiation shielding, to determine electron and ion density, and to study erosion. It had a beacon transmitter and a SECOR (SEquentail COllation of Range) experiment. For its primary mission, Discoverer 32 was equipped with a panoramic camera with a focal length of 61 cm, which had a maximum resolution of 7.6 m. Images were recorded onto 70 mm film, and returned in a Satellite Recovery Vehicle, which was deorbited one day after launch. The Satellite Recovery Vehicle used by Discoverer 32 was SRV-555. Following the return of its images, Discoverer 32 remained in orbit until it decayed on 13 November 1961. Most of the images it produced were found to have been out of focus. Discoverer 32 had a mass of 1150 kg.
	
	notes = Discoverer 32 was launched on October 13, 1961 aboard a Thor DM-21-Agena-B from the Vandenberg AFB Launch Complex.
