         description = Discoverer 39 was equipped with infrared sensors for measuring both thermal emissions and reflected solar radiation from the earth and its atmosphere. The satellite was probably a continuation of the Discoverer program for detecting cosmic radiation and micrometeoroid impacts and their effects on spacecraft. The satellite consisted of a cylindrical rocket body approximately 6 m long and 1.5 m in diameter. The spacecraft burned up upon reentering the earth's atmosphere on May 25, 1962. It was launched on April 18, 1962 aboard a Thor-Agena B booster from Vandenberg AFB.
