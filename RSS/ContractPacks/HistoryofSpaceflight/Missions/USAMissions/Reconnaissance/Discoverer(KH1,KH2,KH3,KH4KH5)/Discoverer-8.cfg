	description = The Discoverer 8 spacecraft consisted of a main satellite body and a separable reentry vehicle containing a recovery capsule. It was designed to test launching techniques, propulsion, communications, orbital performance, engineering, and recovery techniques. The spacecraft was successfully put into a near-polar orbit by the Thor-Agena A booster. After 15 orbits the reentry vehicle was separated from the main body by ground command and the capsule released over the Pacific Ocean for descent to Earth. The descent parachute failed to deploy and the capsule impacted the ocean outside the planned descent area and was not recovered.

	synopsis = Discoverer 8 was launched on a Thor-Agena A rocket on November 20, 1959 from the Vandenberg AFB launch site.
