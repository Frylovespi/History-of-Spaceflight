    description = Discoverer 36, also known as Corona 9029, was an American optical reconnaissance satellite which was a KH-3 Corona satellite, based on an Agena-B rocket. It was the penultimate KH-3 satellite to be launched, the last successful mission, and the most successful of the program. OSCAR 1, the first amateur radio satellite, was launched aboard the same rocket.\n\nThe program objectives consisted of reconnaissance photography, testing various space vehicle components, continuing evaluation of the Agena vehicle and recovery system, conducting experiments in radio propagation and radiation effects, and testing of instrumentation for nuclear explosion detection.\n\nThe re-entry capsule was recovered from the ocean after four days and 64 orbits. Discoverer 36 remained in orbit until it decayed on 8 March 1962. It was launched on December 12, 1961 aboard a Thor-Agena-B from the Vandenberg AFB Launch Complex.
