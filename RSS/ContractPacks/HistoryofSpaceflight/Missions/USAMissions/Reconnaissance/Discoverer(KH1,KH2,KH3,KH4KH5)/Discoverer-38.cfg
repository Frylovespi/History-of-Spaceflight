         description = Discoverer 38 was an earth-orbiting satellite designed to improve satellite control, to test various space vehicle components, to continue evaluation of the Agena vehicle and recovery system, to conduct experiments in radio propagation, radiation effect, and instrumentation for nuclear explosion detection, and to eject and recover a reentry capsule. In addition to the usual Discoverer series instrumentation and telemetry, the payload included a horizon scanner, radiation measuring instruments, cosmic-ray monitors, magnetometers, an impedance probe, and a radio propagation probe operating on 20.005 and 40 MHz. It was launched on February 27, 1962 aboard a Thor-Agena B booster from Vandenberg AFB.
