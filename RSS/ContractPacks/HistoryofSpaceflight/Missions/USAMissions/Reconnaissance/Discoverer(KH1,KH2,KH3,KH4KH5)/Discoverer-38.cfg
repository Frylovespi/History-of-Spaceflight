	description = Discoverer 38 was an earth-orbiting satellite designed to improve satellite control, to test various space vehicle components, to continue evaluation of the Agena vehicle and recovery system, to conduct experiments in radio propagation, radiation effect, and instrumentation for nuclear explosion detection, and to eject and recover a reentry capsule. In addition to the usual Discoverer series instrumentation and telemetry, the payload included a horizon scanner, radiation measuring instruments, cosmic-ray monitors, magnetometers, an impedance reconnaissance satellite, and a radio propagation reconnaissance satellite operating on 20.005 and 40 MHz. 

	notes = Launch the Discoverer 38 reconnaissance satellite into a polar orbit and recover film the capsule intact.
	synopsis = Discoverer 38 was launched on February 27, 1962 aboard a Thor-Agena B booster from Vandenberg AFB.
