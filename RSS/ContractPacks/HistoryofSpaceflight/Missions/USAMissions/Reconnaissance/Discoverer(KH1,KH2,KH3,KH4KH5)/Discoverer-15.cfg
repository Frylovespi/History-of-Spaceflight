         description = The Discoverer 15 spacecraft consisted of a main satellite body and a separable reentry vehicle containing a recovery capsule. It was designed to test launching techniques, propulsion, communications, orbital performance, engineering, and recovery techniques. The recovery capsule was ejected, but retrieval was not possible due to inclement weather conditions. It had a mass of 783 kg (excluding propellants) and was launched on a Thor-Agena B rocket on October 26, 1960 from the Vandenberg AFB launch site.
