         description = The Discoverer 5 spacecraft consisted of a main satellite body and a separable reentry vehicle containing a recovery capsule. It was designed to test launching techniques, propulsion, communications, orbital performance, engineering, and recovery techniques. The spacecraft was successfully put into a near-polar 193 x 353 km orbit by the Thor-Agena A booster. The recovery capsule was ejected, but retrieval was not possible due to inclement weather conditions. It had a mass of 783 kg (excluding propellants) and was launched on a Thor-Agena B rocket on October 26, 1960 from the Vandenberg AFB launch site.
