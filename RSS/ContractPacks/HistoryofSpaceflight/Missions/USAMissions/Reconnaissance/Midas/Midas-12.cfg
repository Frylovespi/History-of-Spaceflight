         description = The MIDAS 12 (MIssile Defense Alarm System) satellite was designed primarily to detect the exhaust heat from a recently launched ICBM by use of infrared sensors. A secondary objective was to eject 350 million copper needles into earth orbit (Project West Ford). The needles were to serve as an artificial scattering medium for radio signals in the centimeter band. The spacecraft was cylindrically shaped measuring approximately 6 m in length and 1.5 m in diameter. Once in orbit, the spacecraft was stabilized in a nose-down attitude so that the IR sensors and telemetry antenna were always facing earthward. It was launched from an Atlas-Agena D rocket from the Vandenberg AFB launch site on October 5, 1966.
