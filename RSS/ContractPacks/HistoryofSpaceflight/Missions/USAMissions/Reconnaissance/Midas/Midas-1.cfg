         description = The MIDAS 1 (Missile Defense Alarm System) satellite was designed to detect the exhaust heat from a recently launched ICBM by use of infrared sensors. Secondary objectives included the measurement of cosmic radiation, the determination of upper atmospheric density, and micrometeoroid detection. The spacecraft was cylindrical in shape and measured approximately 6 m in length and 1.5 m in diameter. The sensors and communication subsystem were chemical-battery-powered. The experiments were never activated because MIDAS 1 failed to achieve its planned polar orbit when the second stage failed to separate. The satellite flew 4500 km before burning up in reentry. It had a mass of 2045.0 kg (including agena stage) and was launched from an Atlas-Agena A rocket from the Cape Canaveral launch site on February 26, 1960.
