         description = The MIDAS 5 (MIssile Defense Alarm System) satellite was designed primarily to detect the exhaust heat from a recently launched ICBM by use of infrared sensors. Secondary objectives included measuring cosmic radiation, energetic particles, and the effects of the space environment on certain metals and emulsions. The spacecraft was cylindrically shaped, measuring approximately 6 m in length and 1.5 m in diameter. Once in orbit, the spacecraft was stabilized in a nose-down attitude so that the IR sensors and antenna were always facing earthward. It was launched from an Atlas-Agena B rocket from the Vandenberg AFB launch site on March 9, 1962.
