    description = SAMOS 3 was a US Air Force first generation photo surveillance satellite attempted to be launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base aboard an Atlas Agena-B rocket. The Atlas exploded on the pad at the moment of takeoff. The rocket reached an altitude of 1 meter when the engine shut down because of a signal from an umbilical cable which failed to detach. The rocket fell back to the launch pad and exploded. SAMOS 3 had a mass of 1900.0 kg (excluding the Agena).
