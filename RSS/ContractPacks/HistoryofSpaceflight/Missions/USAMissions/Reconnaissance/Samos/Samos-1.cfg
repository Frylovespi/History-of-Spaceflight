         description = SAMOS-1 was the first in the series of Satellite and Missile Observation Satellites (SAMOS) launched by the US Air Force from Vandenberg Air Force Base aboard an Atlas Agena-A rocket. It was a first generation photo surveillance satellite intended to radio relay images back to Earth but loss of nitrogen gas pressure disrupted the guidance and control systems, causing a second stage failure. No data were returned. The major objective of the SAMOS-1 mission was to determine the engineering feasibility of obtaining ground observation capability from an orbiting satellite. SAMOS-1 was launched from Vandenberg AFB on October 10, 1960 on an Atlas-Agena A launch vehicle.
