	description = SAMOS-1 was the first in the series of Satellite and Missile Observation Satellites (SAMOS) launched by the US Air Force from Vandenberg Air Force Base. It was a first generation photo surveillance satellite intended to radio relay images back to Earth but loss of nitrogen gas pressure disrupted the guidance and control systems, causing a second stage failure. No data were returned. The major objective of the SAMOS-1 mission was to determine the engineering feasibility of obtaining ground observation capability from an orbiting satellite.\n\nThe payload comprised photographic and related test equipment, telemetry, radiation, tracking, and command instrumentation. The payload was housed in the Agena second stage. The entire stage was designed to go into orbit. The stage, including payload and casing, had a planned orbital mass of 1845 kg. It was a 6.7 meter high, 1.5 meter diameter cylinder. SAMOS-1 was launched from Vandenberg AFB on October 10, 1960, atop an Atlas-Agena A launch vehicle.
