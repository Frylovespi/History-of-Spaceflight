         description = Codenamed Corona, the Key Hole-4 was a reconnaissance satellite used by the United States from 1962 to 1963. It acquired imagery intelligence by taking photographs and returning the undeveloped film to earth. It achieved a typical ground-resolution of 7.5m and frame coverage of 308 km x 308 km. The Film was returned by a single General Electric return vehicle (SRV, Satellite Return Vehicle). FTV-1129 was launched on June 23, 1962 aboard a Thor-Agena B booster from Vandenberg AFB.
