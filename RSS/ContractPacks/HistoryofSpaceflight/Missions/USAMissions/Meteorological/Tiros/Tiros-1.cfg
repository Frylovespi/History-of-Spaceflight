	description = The TIROS Program (Television Infrared Observation Satellite) was NASA's first experimental step to determine if satellites could be useful in the study of the Earth. At that time, the effectiveness of satellite observations was still unproven. Since satellites were a new technology, the TIROS Program also tested various design issues for spacecraft: instruments, data and operational parameters. The goal was to improve satellite applications for Earth-bound decisions, such as "should we evacuate the coast because of the hurricane?".

	notes = Launch TIROS 1, the first weather satellite, into orbit.
	synopsis = TIROS 1 was launched from a Thor-Able rocket from the Cape Canaveral launch site on April 1, 1960.
