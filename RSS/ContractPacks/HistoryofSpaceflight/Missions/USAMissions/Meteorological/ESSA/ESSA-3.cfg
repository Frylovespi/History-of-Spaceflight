         description = ESSA 3 was a spin-stabilized operational meteorological spacecraft designed to take and record daytime cloudcover pictures on a global basis for subsequent playback to a ground acquisition station. The satellite had essentially the same configuration as that of the TIROS series, i.e., an 18-sided right prism, 107 cm across opposite corners and 56 cm high, with a reinforced baseplate carrying most of the subsystems and a cover assembly (hat). Electrical power was provided by approximately 10,000 1- by 2-cm solar cells that were mounted on the cover assembly and by 21 nickel-cadmium batteries. Two redundant wide-angle cameras were mounted on opposite sides of the spacecraft and canted 75 deg from the spacecraft spin axis. A pair of crossed-dipole command and receiving antennas projected out and down from the baseplate. A monopole telemetry and tracking antenna extended up from the top of the cover assembly. It had a mass of 145.0 kg and was launched from a Thor-Delta D rocket from the Cape Canaveral launch site on October 2, 1966.
