         description = Courier 1B was an experimental military communications satellite that could record messages from an Earth station and rebroadcast them. It was launched from Cape Canaveral and operated in Earth orbit for 17 days. Run by the U.S. Army Advanced Research Project Agency, Courier was a successor to the SCORE program. The objective of the mission was to put the satellite into a 1000 km (600 mile) altitude Earth orbit and test the feasibility of a global military communications network using "delayed repeater" satellites, which receive and store information until commanded to transmit. It had a mass of 225.0 kg and was launched on an Thor-Ablestar rocket from the Cape Canaveral launch site on October 4, 1960.
