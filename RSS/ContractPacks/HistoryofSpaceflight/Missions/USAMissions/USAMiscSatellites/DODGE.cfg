         description = The DODGE (Department of Defense Gravity Experiment) satellite was orbited primarily to study a number of advanced biaxial and triaxial gravity-gradient stabilization techniques at near-synchronous altitudes. Secondary objectives included obtaining measurements of the earth's magnetic field at near-synchronous altitudes and black-and-white and color TV photography of the entire earth disk. DODGE was launched as part of a multiple DOD satellite payload that included DATS 1, LES 5, and IDCSP 16, 17, and 18. The satellite was in the form of an octagonal aluminum shell with a truncated pyramid at the top and a 25.4-cm-diameter cylindrical mast extending 1.57 m from the satellite base. The satellite body was 2.41 m long and 1.22 m in diameter. It was launched by the US Air Force from Cape Canaveral aboard a Titan IIIC rocket. It had a mass of 102.0 kg and was launched on July 1, 1967.
