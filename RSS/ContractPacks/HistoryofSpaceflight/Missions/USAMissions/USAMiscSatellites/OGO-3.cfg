         description = The purpose of the OGO 3 spacecraft, the third of a series of six Orbiting Geophysical Observatories, was to conduct many diversified geophysical experiments to obtain a better understanding of the earth as a planet. OGO 3 consisted of a main body that was parallelepipedal in form, two solar panels, each with a solar-oriented experiment package (SOEP), and two orbital plane experiment packages (OPEP). It had a mass of 514.8 kg and was launched from a Atlas-Agena B rocket from the Cape Canaveral launch site on June 7, 1966.
