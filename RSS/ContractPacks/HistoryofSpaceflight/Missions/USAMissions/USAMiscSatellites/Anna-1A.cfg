         description = ANNA 1B (acronym for "Army, Navy, NASA, Air Force") was a US Navy geodetic satellite. ANNA 1A was spherically shaped with a diameter of 0.91 meters and a weight of 161 kg. It was powered by a band of solar cells located around its equator supported by nickel-cadmium batteries. A communications antenna was wrapped around the spiral surface of the satellite. It was launched aboard a Thor-Ablestar rocket on May 10, 1962 from the Cape Canaveral launch site but failed to reach orbit.
