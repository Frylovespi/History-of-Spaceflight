         description = LOFTI 2A (Low Frequency Trans Ionospheric Satellite) was a US military research satellite. It contained VLF experiments. It was used to conduct research into the propagation of very low frequency radio signals in the ionosphere, and to investigate if these signals could be received by submarines. A 136.17 MHz transmitter was used for this investigation. LOFTI-2A had a mass of 26.0 kg and was launched by a Thor-Agena D rocket from Vandenberg AFB on July 15, 1963.
