         description = The major objective of the Beacon project was to place a 12-foot diameter inflatable sphere in orbit to study atmospheric density at various levels through visual observations. A secondary objective was to place a third stage instrumented payload casing in orbit. The Beacon 1 mission failed when the upper stages and payload separated from the Redstone first stage prior to first stage burnout. It had a mass of 21.0 kg and was launched from a Juno-I rocket from the Cape Canaveral launch site on October 24, 1958.
