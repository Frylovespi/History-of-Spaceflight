         description = The second and final launch of the Beacon project, Beacon 2 was launched using a Juno 2 rocket. It was a thin plastic sphere (12-feet in diameter inflated) launched to study the upper atmosphere. Premature fuel depletion in the first stage combined with an upper stage guidance system malfunction resulted in failure of the mission. The major objective of the Beacon project was to place a 12-foot diameter inflatable sphere in orbit to study atmospheric density at various levels through visual observations. A secondary objective was to place a third stage instrumented payload casing in orbit. It had a mass of 4.2 kg and was launched from a Juno-II rocket from the Cape Canaveral launch site on August 15, 1959.
