         description = Relay 1 was principally a communications satellite. Included in its payload were radiation experiments designed to map the earth's radiation belts. The spin-stabilized spacecraft had an initial spin rate of 167.3 rpm and an initial spin axis orientation with a declination of -68.3 deg and a right ascension of -56 deg. Shortly after launch, two basic problems evolved. One was the satellite's response to spurious commands, and the other was the leakage of a high-power regulator. This leakage caused the first 2 weeks of satellite operation to be useless. After this period, satellite operation returned to normal. It had a mass of 170.0 kg and was launched from a Thor-Delta rocket from the Cape Canaveral launch site on December 13, 1962.
