         description = ESRS(Environmental Sciences Research Satellite) was a magnetospheric research satellite. It failed to reach orbit when the second stage of the launch vehicle exploded. Although details remain sketchy, it appears as if an experimental radar satellite program was started during the Kennedy administration. This program, known as Quill, produced three satellites: two flight models and a test model. One satellite was launched in 1964. It used a radar that was probably built by Raytheon to take images of the ground which were stored on magnetic tape. Quill used the same recovery system as the Corona reconnaissance satellite, returning the magnetic tape to Earth in a recoverable capsule that was caught in mid-air by an aircraft. It had a mass of 79.0 kg and was launched from a Scout-X4 rocket from the Vandenberg AFB launch site on June 25, 1964.
