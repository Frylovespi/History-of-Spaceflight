         description = SECOR 7 (SEquential COllation of Range) was a US Army/USAF spacecraft launched from Vandenberg AFB aboard an Atlas Agena-D rocket. This small geodetic satellite was used to precisely determine points on the earth. Experiments with these led to Timation, and finally to the GPS Navstar system. It had a mass of 18.0 kg and was launched from an Atlas-Agena D rocket from the Vandenberg AFB launch site on August 19, 1966.
