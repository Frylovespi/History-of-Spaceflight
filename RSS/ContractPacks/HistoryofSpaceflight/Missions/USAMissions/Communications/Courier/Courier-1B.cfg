	description = Courier 1B was an experimental military communications satellite that could record messages from an Earth station and rebroadcast them. It was launched from Cape Canaveral and operated in Earth orbit for 17 days. Run by the U.S. Army Advanced Research Project Agency, Courier was a successor to the SCORE program. The objective of the mission was to put the satellite into a 1000 km altitude Earth orbit and test the feasibility of a global military communications network using "delayed repeater" satellites, which receive and store information until commanded to transmit. Courier 1B was covered with 19,200 solar cells, charging nickel-cadmium batteries, providing 60 W power, and a mass of 225 kg. The satellite had the capability to simultaneously transmit, receive, and store approximately 68,000 coded words per minute.
