         description = Developed by Bell Telephone Laboratories for AT&T, Telstar-2 was the world's second active communications satellite. The Telstar program demonstrated the feasibility of transmitting information via satellite, gained experience in satellite tracking and studied the effect of Van Allen radiation belts on satellite design. The satellite was spin-stabilized to maintain its desired orientation in space. Power to its onboard equipment was provided by a solar array, in conjunction with a battery back-up system. On May 16, 1965, at 1403 UT, during the satellite's 4736 orbit, the VHF transmitter was turned off. All systems operated normally until that time. It was launched from a Thor-Delta-B rocket from the Cape Canaveral launch site on May 7, 1963.
