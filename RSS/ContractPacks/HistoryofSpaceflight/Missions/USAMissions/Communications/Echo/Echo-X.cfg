         description = The Echo-X A-10 spacecraft was a 100-foot passive reflector sphere that was intended to be used is a series of communications experiments. During the coast period, the attitude control jets on the second stage failed and the spacecraft did not achieve orbit. It had a mass of 56.2 kg and was launched from a Thor-Delta rocket from the Cape Canaveral launch site on May 13, 1960.
