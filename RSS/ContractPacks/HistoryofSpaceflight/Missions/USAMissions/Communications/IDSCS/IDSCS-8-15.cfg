	description = The Initial Defense Communications Satellite Program provided the Pentagon with its first geosynchronous communications system. IDCSP satellites were spin-stabilized 26 sided polygons, 86 cm in diameter, covered with solar panels, and had a mass of 45 kg. Eight were dispersed on a single Titan 3C rocket into slightly sub-synchronous orbit where they would drift about thirty degrees per day. The idea was that a backup was always visible to the earth station if one failed. IDCSP satellites transmitted reconnaissance photos and other data during the Vietnam war. They were succeeded by NATO and DSCS true geosynchronous satellites. This batch of 8 satellites never reached orbit as the 2nd stage Titan III guidance system failed.
	
	notes = Launch the first 7 IDSCS satellites numbers 1-7 into orbit.
    synopsis = Launch seven IDSCS satellites on a Titan III rocket from the Vandenberg AFB launch site on August 26, 1966.
