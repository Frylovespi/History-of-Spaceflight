         description = Transit 4A was a relatively small spacecraft. It was launched with two other spacecraft from the same launch vehicle. Its shape was nearly cylindrical (22-faced right prisms plus a base and top), 109 cm in diameter, and 79 cm in height. Most of the spacecraft surfaces were covered with solar cells for use with nickel-cadmium batteries. The primary mission was to serve as one of four operational navigational satellites for use by ships and aircraft. In addition, Transit 4A carried a nuclear power source for testing. It was launched from a Thor-Ablestar rocket from the Cape Canaveral launch site on June 29, 1961.
