         description = The Early Bird (INTELSAT 1) was the first operational satellite for the COMSAT Corporation. The satellite was cylindrical in shape, measuring 710-mm diameter and 584-mm in height, and weighed 38.6 kg. It was the first commercial communications satellite to be placed in geosynchronous orbit. The satellite was operated by COMSAT in cooperation with the International Telecommunications Satellite Consortium (INTELSAT). It was capable of television broadcast forwarding between Europe and the US. It helped provide the first live TV coverage of a spacecraft splashdown, that of Gemini 6 in December 1965. Originally slated to operate for 18 months, Early Bird was in active service for 4 years, being deactivated in January 1969, although it was briefly activated in June of that year to serve the Apollo 11 flight when the Atlantic Intelsat satellite failed. It was placed into a 3.12 degree inclination near equatorial orbit. It had a mass of 149.0 kg and was launched from a Thor-Delta D rocket from the Cape Canaveral launch site on April 6, 1965.
