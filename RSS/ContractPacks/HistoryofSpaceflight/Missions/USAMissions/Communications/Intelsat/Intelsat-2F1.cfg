         description = Intelsat 2 F-1 was a COMSAT Corporation commercial communications satellite. The apogee monitor malfunctioned and resulted in the spacecraft ending up in an elliptical orbit. The apogee kick motor failed to burn properly and the spacecraft was left in an unusable orbit. This led to mission failure as the satellite was not usable for its intended purpose. It had a mass of 355.0 kg and was launched from a Thor-Delta E rocket from the Cape Canaveral launch site on October 26, 1966.
