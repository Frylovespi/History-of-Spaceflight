         description = LES 1 (Lincoln Experimental Satellite 1) was a US military communications satellite. It contained solid-state X-band radio equipment, low-power logic circuits, electronic despinning (using optics to determine the location of the Earth and Sun relative to a spinning satellite at any moment, and then transmitting via whichever of several antennae were best positioned with respect to the Earth), and magnetic torquers. It had a mass of 31.0 kg and was launched from a Titan-3A rocket from the Cape Canaveral launch site on February 11, 1965.
