         description = Syncom 2 was the first geosynchronous satellite. Although the period was 24 hours and the 
spacecraft remained at a nearly constant longitude, the orbit was inclined at 33 degrees so it was not truly geostationary but moved in an elongated figure eight pattern 33 degrees north and south of the equator. Syncom 2 was an experimental communications satellite placed over the Atlantic Ocean and Brazil at 55 degrees longitude. It began regular service on August 16th. It demonstrated the feasibility of geosynchronous satellite communications. Voice, teletype, facsimile, and data transmission tests were successfully conducted between the Lakehurst, New Jersey ground station and the USNS Kingsport while the ship was at sea off the coast of Africa and television transmissions were relayed from Lakehurst to the telstar ground station at Andover, Maine. The Syncoms were the forerunners of the Intelsat series of satellites. It had a mass of 39.0 kg and was launched from a Thor-Delta rocket from the Cape Canaveral launch site on July 26, 1963.
