	description = The Bell X-2, nicknamed Starbuster, was an X-plane research aircraft built to investigate flight characteristics in the Mach 2–3 range. The X-2 was a rocket-powered, swept-wing research aircraft developed jointly in 1945 by Bell Aircraft Corporation, the United States Air Force and the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) to explore aerodynamic problems of supersonic flight and to expand the speed and altitude regimes obtained with the earlier X-1 series of research aircraft.\n\nProviding adequate stability and control for aircraft flying at high supersonic speeds was only one of the major difficulties facing flight researchers as they approached Mach 3. For, at speeds in that region, they knew they would also begin to encounter a "thermal barrier", severe heating effects caused by aerodynamic friction. Constructed of stainless steel and a copper-nickel alloy, K-Monel, and powered by a liquid propellant (alcohol and oxygen) two-chamber XLR25 11 to 67 kN sea level thrust, continuously throttleable rocket engine, the swept-wing Bell X-2 was designed to probe the supersonic region.\n\nA less experienced but excellent pilot, Milburn G. 'Mel' Apt, was assigned the job of further expanding the envelope and, on 27 September, Apt was launched from the B-50 for his first flight in a rocket airplane. He had been instructed to follow the 'optimum maximum energy flight path' and to avoid any rapid control movements beyond Mach 2.7. Apt flew an extraordinarily precise profile; he became the first man to exceed Mach 3, reaching Mach 3.2 (3,370 km/h, 2,094 mph) at 19,960 m (65,500 ft).
	
	synopsis = Launch an airplane from the runway, fly between 10,000 m and 30,000 m, exceed 1098 m/s in level flight for 5 seconds, and then land back at the runway safely.
