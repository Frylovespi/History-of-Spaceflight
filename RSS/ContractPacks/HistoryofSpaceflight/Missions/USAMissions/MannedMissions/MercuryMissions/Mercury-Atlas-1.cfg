	description = Mercury-Atlas-1 was the first attempt to launch a Mercury capsule. The spacecraft was unmanned and carried no launch escape system. The Atlas rocket suffered a structural failure 58 seconds after launch. All telemetry signals suddenly ceased as the vehicle was passing through Max Q. Because the day was rainy and overcast, the booster was out of sight from 26 seconds after launch, and it was impossible to see what happened. This attempted launch of the first Mercury-Atlas rocket occurred on July 29, 1960, at the Cape Canaveral Launch Complex.
