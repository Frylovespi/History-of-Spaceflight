    description = Mercury-Redstone 1A (MR-1A) was launched from Launch Complex 5 at Cape Canaveral, Florida. The mission objectives of this unmanned suborbital flight were to qualify the spacecraft for space flight and qualify the system for an upcoming primate suborbital flight. The spacecraft tested its instrumentation, posigrade rockets, retrorockets and recovery system.\n\nThe mission was completely successful. The Mercury capsule reached an altitude of 210 km and a range of 378 km. The launch vehicle reached a slightly higher velocity than expected 7,900 km/h. The Mercury spacecraft was recovered from the Atlantic Ocean by recovery helicopters about 15 minutes after landing. The flight time was 15 minutes and 45 seconds.\n\nMercury Redstone 1A was launched on December 19, 1960 from the Cape Canaveral Launch Complex.
