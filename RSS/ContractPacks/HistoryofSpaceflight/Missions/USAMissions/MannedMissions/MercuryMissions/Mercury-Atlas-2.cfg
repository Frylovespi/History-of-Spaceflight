	description = Mercury-Atlas-2 was the second attempt to launch an Atlas with an attached Mercury capsule. The spacecraft was unmanned but as unlike the previous Mercury-Atlas-1 this mission carried the launch escape system. The mission was launched from Launch Complex 14 at Cape Canaveral, Florida. Test objectives for this flight were concerned with the ability of the spacecraft to withstand reentry under the temperature-critical abort conditions and with the capability of the Atlas to meet the proper injection conditions. Convair had promised to deliver thicker-skinned Atlas vehicles for subsequent flights, however Missile 67D was the last of the thin-skinned model and so it had to be modified for the Mercury mission, incorporating a stainless steel reinforcing band installed around the vehicle between stations 502 and 510. A thin sheet of asbestos was installed between the reinforcing band and the tank skin. This modification was installed as a precaution against the type of failure which had occurred on the previous MA-1 flight. Mercury-Atlas-2 flew a successful suborbital mission that lasted 17 minutes 56 seconds. Altitude reached was 183 km, speed, 21,287 km/h. All test objectives were fully met, the only problems being a bit of propellant slosh. The capsule was recovered 2305 km downrange.
