	description = Mercury-Redstone 1 (MR-1) was the first Mercury-Redstone unmanned flight test in Project Mercury and the first attempt to launch a Mercury spacecraft with the Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle. Intended  to be a sub-orbital spaceflight, it was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida.\n\nThe launch failed in a peculiar fashion which has been referred to as the "four-inch flight". The Redstone's engine failed 4s after launch and the Redstone settled back onto the pad. Instead of exploding, the launch escape tower jettisoned, leaving the cargo-less rocket sitting precariously on the pad. Fortunately, weather conditions prevailed and the rocket did not tip over.\n\nThis attempted launch of the first Mercury-Redstone rocket occurred on November 21, 1960, at the Cape Canaveral Launch Complex.
