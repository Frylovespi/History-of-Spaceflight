    description = Mercury-Atlas 3 (MA-3) was an unmanned spaceflight of the Mercury program. It was launched unmanned from Launch Complex 14 at Cape Canaveral, Florida. The Mercury capsule contained a robotic "mechanical astronaut". Mercury spacecraft No. 8 and Atlas No. 8 100-D were used in the mission. The launch ended in failure when the pitch and roll sequence failed to initiate and the vehicle had no ability control itself. The range safety was activated at 43 seconds into the flight and Mercury-Atlas 3 fell back to earth as a rain of fiery debris. The Atlas used for the flight incorporated a number of technical improvements including thicker skin to handle the added weight of the Mercury capsule and prevent a recurrence of the Mercury-Atlas 1 failure. In addition, it sported a new, transistorized telemetry unit to replace the old-fashioned system used on previous Atlas vehicles which utilized vacuum tubes, was bulky, had high power consumption, and whose signal strength tended to degrade during launch.
