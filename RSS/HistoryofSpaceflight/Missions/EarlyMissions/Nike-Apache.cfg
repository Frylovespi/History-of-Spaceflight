         description = Nike-Apache was an American sounding rocket. The most popular sounding rocket introduced during the early 1960's was this two-stage, solid-propellant vehicle consisting of a Nike booster and Apache upper stage. The primary difference was the propellant and the phenolic lining of the Apache steel nozzle. The Cajun did not have this lining, and the direct exposure of its steel can to high exhaust temperatures was considered undesirable. The Marquardt Asp was tried as a replacement for the Cajun but did not prove satisfactory. NASA eventually adopted the Apache, which had already been developed by Thiokol in Elkton, Md. There were a total of 893 Nike-Apache launches before their retirement in 1980. It had a thrust of 217.0 kN, a height of 8.31 m, a diameter of 0.42 m, and an apogee of 200 km. It was first flown on March 18, 1958 from the White Sands Missile Range.
