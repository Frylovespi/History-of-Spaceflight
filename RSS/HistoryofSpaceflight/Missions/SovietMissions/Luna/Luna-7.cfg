         description = The Luna 7 spacecraft was intended to achieve a soft landing on the Moon. However, due to loss of attitude control during the final approach to the lunar surface, the retrorockets were prevented from firing to slow the spacecraft and it impacted the lunar surface at 9.8 N, 47.8 W in the Sea of Storms on 4 October 1965 at 22:08:24 UT. It had a mass of 1504.5 kg and was launched from a Molniya-M 8K78M rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on May 9, 1965.
