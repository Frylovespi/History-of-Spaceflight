         description = Explorer 33 was a spin-stabilized (spin axis parallel to the ecliptic plane, spin period varying between 2.2 and 3.6 s) spacecraft instrumented for studies of interplanetary plasma, energetic charged particles (electrons, protons, and alphas), magnetic fields, and solar X rays at lunar distances. The spacecraft failed to achieve lunar orbit but did achieve mission objectives.  It had a mass of 212.0 kg and was launched from a Thor-Delta rocket from the Cape Canaveral launch site on May 25, 1966.
