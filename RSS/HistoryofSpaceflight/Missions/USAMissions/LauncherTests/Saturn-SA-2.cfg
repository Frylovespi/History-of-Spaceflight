         description = This was the second test flight of the Saturn I (SA-2) booster. The Saturn 1st stage carried dummy water-filled 2nd and 3rd stages to 105 km altitude where they were detonated, causing the 86,000 kg water ballast to create an artificial cloud. This test was also known as Project High Water I. Maximum velocity was about 6000 kph. The test objectives of launch vehicle verification were successfully completed. It was launched on April 25, 1962 from the Cape Canaveral launch site.
