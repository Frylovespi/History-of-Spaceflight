         description = Biosatellite-1 carried biological specimens to determine the effects of the space environment on life processes. The reentry vehicle separated but the rocket failed, leaving the capsule in orbit. No useful scientific data were obtained. It had a mass of 950.0 kg and was launched from an Thor-Delta G rocket from the Cape Canaveral launch site on December 14, 1966.
