         description = Vela 1A was one of two spin-stabilized (2.1 rev/sec) 124-kg satellites comprising the first launch in a series of six Vela launches. The orbits of the two satellites on each launch were basically circular at about 17 earth radii and were spaced 180 deg apart. Their objectives were to monitor nuclear weapons explosions in space and to study x-rays, gamma-rays, neutrons, and charged particles as the satellites passed through interplanetary space, the bow shock, the magnetosheath, and the magnetotail. The satellite operated in either a real-time mode (one data frame/sec) or a memory store mode (one data frame every 256 sec). It had a mass of 150.0 kg and was launched from a Atlas-Agena D rocket from the Cape Canaveral launch site on October 17, 1963.
