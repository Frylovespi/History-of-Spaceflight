         description = Vela 3A was one of two polyhedral satellites comprising the third in a series of six Vela launches. The orbits of the two satellites on each launch were basically circular at a radial distance of about 17 earth radii and spaced 180 deg apart. It had a mass of 150.0 kg and was launched from a Atlas-Agena D rocket from the Cape Canaveral launch site on July 20, 1965.
