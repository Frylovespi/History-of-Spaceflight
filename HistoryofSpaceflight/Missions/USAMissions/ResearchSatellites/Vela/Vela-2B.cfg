         description = Vela 2A was one of two spin-stabilized (2 rev/sec) 144-kg satellites comprising the second launch in a series of six Vela launches. The orbits of the two satellites on each launch were basically circular at about 17 earth radii and were spaced 180 deg apart. Their objectives were to monitor nuclear weapons explosions in space and to study x-rays, gamma-rays, neutrons, magnetic fields, and charged particles over a wide range of energies from solar wind to cosmic ray as the satellites passed through interplanetary space, the bow shock, the magnetosheath, and the magnetotail. It had a mass of 150.0 kg and was launched from a Atlas-Agena D rocket from the Cape Canaveral launch site on August 17, 1964.
