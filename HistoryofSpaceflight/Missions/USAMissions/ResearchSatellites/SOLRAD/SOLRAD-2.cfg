         description = SOLRAD-2 was an American series of satellites sponsored by the US Navy in a program to continuously monitor the Sun. SOLRAD was Satellite Techniques' first major project and NRL's first post-Vanguard satellite. This mission was to have been the second of a series intended to monitor solar radiation, primarily in the soft x-ray range of the spectrum. This mission failed because of a launch malfunction. It had a mass of 91.0 kg and was launched on an Thor-Able from the Cape Canaveral launch site on November 30, 1960.
