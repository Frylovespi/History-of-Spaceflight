         description = The Gravity Gradient Stabilization Experiment (GGSE-3) was a technology satellite launched by the US military from Vandenberg AFB aboard a Thor rocket. This was the second in the series that developed designs and deployment techniques later applied to the NOSS/Whitecloud reconnaisance satellites. It had a mass of 39.0 kg and was launched from a Thorad-Agena D rocket from the Vandenberg AFB launch site on April 9, 1965.
