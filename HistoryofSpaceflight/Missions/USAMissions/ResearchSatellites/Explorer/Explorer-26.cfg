         description = Explorer 26 was a spin-stabilized, solar-cell-powered spacecraft instrumented to measure trapped particles and the geomagnetic field. A 16-channel PFM/PM time-division multiplexed telemeter was used. The spacecraft systems functioned well, except for some undervoltage turnoffs, until May 26, 1967, when the telemeter failed. It had a mass of 45.8 kg and was launched from a Thor-Delta rocket from the Cape Canaveral launch site on December 21, 1964.
