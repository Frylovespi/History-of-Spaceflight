         description = Explorer 8 was a 41 kg mercury-battery-powered, earth-orbiting satellite designed to obtain measurements of the electron density, the electron temperature, the ion concentration, the ion mass, the micrometeorite distribution, and the micrometeorite mass in the ionosphere at altitudes between 400 and 1600 km. It was intended to study the temporal and spatial distribution of these properties and their variation from full sunlit conditions to full shadow, or nighttime, conditions. It had a mass of 41.0 kg. It launched atop a Juno-II rocket on November 3, 1960 from the Cape Canaveral launch site.
