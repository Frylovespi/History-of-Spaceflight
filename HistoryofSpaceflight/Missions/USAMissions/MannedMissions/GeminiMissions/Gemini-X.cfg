         description = Gemini 10 was the eighth crewed Earth-orbiting spacecraft of the Gemini series, carrying astronauts John Young and Michael Collins. Its primary purpose was to conduct rendezvous and docking tests with the Agena target vehicle. Rendezvous with the Gemini-X-ATV was completed after four orbits. Docking duration was one day fourteen hours and fourty-five minutes. Gemini-X was launched on July 18, 1966 from the Cape Canaveral launch site.
