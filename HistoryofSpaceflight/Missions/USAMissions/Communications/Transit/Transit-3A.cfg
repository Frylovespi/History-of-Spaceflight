         description = Transit 3A was a US Navy navigation satellite that was destroyed by Range Safety when the Thor Able-Star launch vehicle shut down too early. Transit-3A was a 113-kilogram (249 lb) spacecraft, which was powered by 6,600 solar cells charging a nickel-cadmium battery. Transit 3A included a digital clock to control timing signals, uploading programs into the onboard computer's memory whilst in orbit, data retention and FM encoding, and the use of phase modulation for data transmission without affecting the satellite's Doppler signal. The satellite's computer had a memory capacity of 48 bytes. Transit-3A was launched from Cape Canaveral launch site on November 30, 1960 by a Thor-Able launch vehicle.
