         description = SURCAL 1A - Surveillance Calibration ( Sur Veilance Cal ibration ) - was an American military technology satellite. It was a joint venture between the US Air Force and the US Navy. The first attempt to send the SURCAL satellite, designated SURCAL 1, failed to reach orbit. It had a mass of 37.0 kg and was launched along with SURCAL-2, and Injun-3 from a Thor-Ablestar rocket from the Vandenburg AFB launch site on December 13, 1962.
