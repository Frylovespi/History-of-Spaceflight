         description = Courier 1A was an experimental military communications satellite. The mission failed after 2 1/2 minutes of flight when the first stage exploded. Run by the U.S. Army Advanced Research Project Agency, Courier was a successor to the SCORE program. The objective of the mission was to put the satellite into a 1000 km (600 mile) altitude Earth orbit and test the feasibility of a global military communications network using "delayed repeater" satellites, which receive and store information until commanded to transmit. It had a mass of 225 kg and was launched on a Thor-Ablestar rocket on August 18, 1960 from the Cape Canaveral launch complex.
