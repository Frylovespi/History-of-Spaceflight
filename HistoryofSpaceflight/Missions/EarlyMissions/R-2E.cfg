         description = The Soviet R-2 ballistic missile was developed in 1947-1953, nearly in parallel with the R-1 from which it derived. It incorporated many detailed improvements, had double the range of the R-1 and V-2, and was equipped with a deadly radiological warhead. The ethyl alcohol used in the V-2 and R-1 was replaced by methyl alcohol in the R-2, eliminating the problem of the launch troops drinking up the rocket fuel. Versions of the R-2 for suborbital manned flight were studied by Korolev in 1956-1958, but it was decided instead to move directly to orbital flights of the Vostok. The R-2 design was transferred to China in 1957 to 1961, providing the technical basis of the Chinese rocket industry. The first launch of an R-2 was on October 1, 1950 at the Kaspuin Yar launch Complex. It had a payload of 570 kg, a range of 508km, and thrust of 364.90 kN. It had a height of 17.68m, and a diameter of 1.83m. It was first launched on October 1, 1950 from the Kasputin Yar Launch Complex.
