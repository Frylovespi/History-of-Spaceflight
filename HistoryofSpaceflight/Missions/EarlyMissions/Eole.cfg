         description = Eole was a French test vehicle. Second missile developed by Jean-Jacques Barre and end of that lineage. On 17 May 1946 the French DEFA Agency established the LRBA (Ballistics and Aeronautical Research Laboratory). Jean-Jacques Barre was authorized to develop an improved version of his EA 1941 wartime indigenous rocket design on 15 October, 1946. This development was in competition with the Veronique, being developed for LRBA by a German team. The Eole had a thrust of 100.00 kN, a height of 11.02 m, a diameter of 0.80 m, and a payload 680 kg. It was first launched on November 22, 1952 from the Hammaguira launch site.
