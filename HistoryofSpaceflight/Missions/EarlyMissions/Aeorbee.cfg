         description = The Aerobee sounding rockets were derived from the Aerojet Wac Corporal and the Bumblebee missile developed under a US Navy program. This combination of an Aerojet booster and a Bumblebee second stage was dubbed the Aerobee. Aerobees were launched from 53 m tall launch towers to provide the necessary stability until enough speed had been gained for the fins to be effective in controlling the rocket. Launch towers were built at White Sands, Fort Churchill, Wallops Island, and aboard the research ship USN Norton Sound. There were a total of 35 Aerobees launched until its retirement in November of 1959. It had a payload of 68.00 kg, a thrust of 18.0 kN, a height of 7.80 m, a diameter of 0.38 m, and an apogee of 130 km. It was first flown on July 16, 1957.
