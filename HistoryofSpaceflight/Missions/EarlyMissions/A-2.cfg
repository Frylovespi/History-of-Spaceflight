         description = After the Aggregat-1 failed to launch, work started on a replacement. This lead to the Aggregat-2 or A-2. The A-2 was designed by Wernher von Braun under the program at Kummersdorf headed by Walter Dornberger in 1934. The A-2 had a length of 1.6m and its outline was simliar to the A-1, except the A-2 had stabilization gyroscopes in the center of the rocket between the alcohol and oxygen tanks. The A-2 had a takeoff weight of 107 kg and a max thrust of 3 kN. Two A-2 were built for testing and were named Max and Moritz after a popular cartoon. The two A-2's launched December 19, 1934 and December 20, 1934 on Borkum island in the North Sea and reached an altitude of 2.2 km and 3.5 km.
