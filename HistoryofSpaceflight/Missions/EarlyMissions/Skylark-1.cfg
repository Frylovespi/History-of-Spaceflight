         description = Skylark-1 was the first British sounding rocket. The Skylark sounding rocket (originally named the Gassiot High Altitude Vehicle) was produced by the Royal Aircraft Establishment and first introduced in 1957, during the International Geophysical Year. It remained in European service until 2005. A total of 169 Skylark-1 rockets were launched before their retirement. Skylark-1 had a length of 7.60 m, a diameter of 0.44 m, a payload of 45 kg, and an apogee of 850 km. It was first flown on February 13, 1957.
