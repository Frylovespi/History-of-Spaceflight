         description = Polyot 2 was the second of two spacecraft fitted with special controls to allow for maneuverability in space. The spacecraft was able to change inclination as well as apogee and perigee. It also carried scientific instruments, a telemetry system, and radio transmitters. It had a mass of 600.0 kg and was launched from a Sputnik 11A59 rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome launch site on April 12, 1964.
