         description = Kosmos-81-84 were Stella 1 type communications satellites. These satellites operate as mailboxes ("store-and-forward"): they remember the received messages and then resend them after scheduled time, or by command from the Earth. All 3 were released in orbit at the same time and it was hoped that natural drift would keep them apart. Each satellite had a mass of 50.0 kg and were launched by the Soviet Union store-and-forward"): they remember the received messages and then resend them after scheduled time, or by command from the Earth. They were launched by the Soviet Union on September 11, 1965 on a Kosmos-1 65S3 rocket from the Tyuratam Launch Complex at the Baikonur Cosmodrome.
