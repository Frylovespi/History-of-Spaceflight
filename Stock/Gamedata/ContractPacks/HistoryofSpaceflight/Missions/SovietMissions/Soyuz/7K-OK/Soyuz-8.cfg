    description = Soyuz 8 (Russian: Union 8) was the second of three manned Soyuz capsules to be launched shortly after each other, with the intention of performing a three capsule rendezvous, including a docking of two of the capsules. Soyuz 8 was launched one day after Soyuz 7. The main role of Soyuz 8 in this mission was to perform a docking with Soyuz 7 and exchange one crewmember, however failure of rendezvous electronics in all three craft due to a new helium pressurization integrity test prevented the close range rendezvous and docking procedures. It was piloted by V. Shatalov, Commander, and A. Yeliseyev, Flight Engineer. Soyuz 8 did perform a group flight with Soyuz 6 and Soyuz 7, but it did not dock with either spacecraft. Soyuz 8 landed back on Earth on October 18, 1969, after nearly 5 days in orbit.
	
    notes = Launch Soyuz-8 towards a rendezvous with Soyuz-6 and Soyuz-7, which are already in orbit together. Perform the first synchronous flight of three different spacecraft before returning all of them back home.
    synopsis = <color=yellow>Soyuz 8 was launched by a Soyuz 11A511 rocket on October 13, 1969 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome.</color>
