    description = Soyuz 7 (Russian: Union 7) was the second of three manned Soyuz capsules to be launched shortly after each other, with the intention of performing a three capsule rendezvous, including a docking of two of the capsules. Soyuz 7 was launched one day after Soyuz 6. The main role of Soyuz 7 in this mission was to perform a docking with Soyuz 8 and exchange one crewmember, however failure of rendezvous electronics in all three craft due to a new helium pressurization integrity test prevented the close range rendezvous and docking procedures. It was piloted by cosmonaut A. Filipchenko, Commander, Flight Engineer V. Volkov, and Research Engineer V. Gorbatko. Soyuz 7 did perform a group flight with Soyuz 6 and Soyuz 8, but it did not dock with either spacecraft. Soyuz 6 landed back on Earth on October 17, 1969, after nearly 5 days in orbit.
	
    notes = Launch Soyuz-7 towards a rendezvous with Soyuz-6, which is already in orbit, then await Soyuz-8.
    synopsis = <color=yellow>Soyuz 7 was launched by a Soyuz 11A511 rocket on October 12, 1969 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome.</color>
