	description = Soyuz 11 (Russian: Union 11) was the only manned mission to board the world's first space station, Salyut 1 (Soyuz 10 had soft-docked but had not been able to enter due to latching issues). Soyuz 11 was piloted by Commander of the Spacecraft Dobrovolski, Flight Engineer Volkov, and Research Engineer Patsayev. The mission arrived at the space station on 7 June 1971, docking took 3 hr 19 min to complete. When the pressure was equalized between the ships, the locks were opened and all three members of the crew passed into Salyut and remained there for 22 days. &br;&br;On June 29 the crew loaded scientific specimens, films, tapes, and other gear into Soyuz 11, then transferred manual control back from Salyut to Soyuz 11 and returned to their ferry craft. Even though automatic systems landed Soyuz 11 safely, the mission ended in disaster when it was found that the crew capsule had depressurised during preparations for reentry, killing the three-man crew.
	
	notes = Memorial Mission to honour Georgy Dobrovolsky, Vladislav Volkov, and Viktor Patsayev; the only humans to have died outside of the atmosphere. Launch Soyuz-11 to Salyut-1, perform docking, science and return safely.
