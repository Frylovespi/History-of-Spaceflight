	description = Zenit-2 3 was the third attempt to launch a Zenit-2 reconnaissance satellite atop a Vostok launch vehicle from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on June 1, 1962. The basic design of the Zenit satellites was similar to the Vostok manned spacecraft, sharing the return and service modules. It consisted of a spherical re-entry capsule 2.3 meters (7.5 ft) in diameter with a mass of around 2,400 kilograms (5,300 lb). This capsule contained the camera system, its film, recovery beacons, parachutes and a destruct charge. Shortly after launch, after reaching an altitude of 300 m, it exploded and did enough damage to put the launch complex out of operation for a month. Therefore the Vostok 3/4 launches could not take place until the end of July at the earliest.

	notes = Launch Zenit-2 3 and explode 300 m from the launch pad.
