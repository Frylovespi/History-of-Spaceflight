	description = Zenit-2 14 was the twelfth attempt to launch a Zenit-2 reconnaissance satellite atop a Vostok-2 launch vehicle from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on November 28, 1963. The basic design of the Zenit satellites was similar to the Vostok manned spacecraft, sharing the return and service modules. It consisted of a spherical re-entry capsule 2.3 meters (7.5 ft) in diameter with a mass of around 2,400 kilograms (5,300 lb). This capsule contained the camera system, its film, recovery beacons, parachutes and a destruct charge. The mission was a failure due to a failure in the block E upper stage. This Zenit spacecraft was liquidated by the auto-destruction system.
