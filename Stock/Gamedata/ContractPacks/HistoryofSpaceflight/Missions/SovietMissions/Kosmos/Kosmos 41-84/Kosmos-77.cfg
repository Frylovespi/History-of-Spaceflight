	description = Kosmos 77 was a Soviet optical-film return reconnaissance satellite launched in 1965. Kosmos 77 was a Zenit-4 type Soviet surveillance satellite launched on an eight day mission by a Voskhod rocket. It was placed in a low Earth orbit with a perigee of 184 km, an apogee of 300 km, an inclination of 51.8 degrees, and an orbital period of 89.3 minutes. Kosmos 77 conducted an eight day reconnaissance mission before deorbiting and landing by parachute in Siberia.
