	description = Kosmos 46, also known as Zenit-2 No.23, was a Soviet optical-film return reconnaissance satellite. Kosmos 46 was the twenty-second of eighty-one satellites in this series to be launched and had a mass of 4,730.0 kilograms. Kosmos 46 was operated in a low Earth orbit; at an epoch of 29 September 1964 it had a perigee of 210 km, an apogee of 261 km, an inclination of 51.2 degrees, and an orbital period of 89.21 minutes. On October 2, 1964 after eight days in orbit the satellite was deorbited with its return capsule descending by parachute for recovery.
