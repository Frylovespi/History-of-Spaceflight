	description = Kosmos 67 was a Soviet optical-film return reconnaissance satellite launched by a Voskhod rocket by the Soviet Union in 1965. Kosmos 67 was a Zenit-4 type Soviet surveillance satellite. It was placed in a low Earth orbit with a perigee of 200 km, an apogee of 346 km, an orbital inclination of 51.8 degrees, and an orbital period of 89.9 minutes. Kosmos 67 conducted an 8 day mission and was deorbited and landed by parachute in Siberia.
