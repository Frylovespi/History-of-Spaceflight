	description = Kosmos 64, also known as Zenit-2 27, was a Soviet optical-film return reconnaissance satellite. Kosmos 64 was the twenty-sixth of eighty-one satellites in this series to be launched. It had a mass of 4,720 kg. Kosmos 64 was placed in a low Earth orbit with a perigee of 203 km, an apogee of 256 km, an inclination of 65 degrees, and an orbital period of 89.09 minutes. On 2 April 1965, after eight days in orbit, Kosmos 64 was deorbited with its return capsule descending by parachute for recovery in Siberia.
