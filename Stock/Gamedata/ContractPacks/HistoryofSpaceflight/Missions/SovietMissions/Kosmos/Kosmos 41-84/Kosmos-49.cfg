	description = Kosmos 49, also known as DS-MG-2, was a technology demonstration satellite instrumented with proton magnetometers to map the earth's magnetic field. This spacecraft, along with Cosmos 26, represented the U.S.S.R. contribution to the IQSY World Magnetic Survey. The shape of the spacecraft was almost an ellipsoid and measured 1.8 m long and 1.2 m in diameter. A boom 3.3 m long was attached from one end of the spacecraft to the magnetometers. 

	synopsis = <color=yellow>Kosmos 49 was launched by a Kosmos-2l 63S1 on October 24, 1964 from the Mayak Launch Complex at Kapustin Yar.</color>
