	description = Kosmos 70, also known as DS-A1 4, was a technology demonstration satellite with a primary mission to demonstrate technologies for future Soviet military satellites. The DS-A1 satellites were developed by Yuzhnoye to test the techniques and equipment for communication and navigation systems and performed radiation measurements. The 250 kg satellites consisted of the battery powered hermetically sealed DS bus, which housed the experiments. Seven satellites, were launched by a Kosmos rockets from Kapustin Yar It was the fourth and final satellite to be launched in the DS-A1 series. Kosmos 70 was placed in an inclined low Earth orbit with a perigee of 215 km, an apogee of 1,147 km, an inclination of 48.8 degrees, and an orbital period of 98.3 minutes.
