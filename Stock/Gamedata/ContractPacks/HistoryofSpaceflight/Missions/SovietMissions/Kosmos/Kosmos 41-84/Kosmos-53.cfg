	description = Kosmos 53, also known as DS-A1-5, was a technology demonstration satellite with a primary mission to demonstrate technologies for future Soviet satellite military satellites. It also conducted radiation experiments. It was the fifth of seven DS-A1 satellites to be launched, and the third to reach orbit. As with earlier DS-A1 satellites, the technological experiments aboard Kosmos 53 were tests of communications and navigation systems which were later used on the GLONASS system. Kosmos 53 was placed into a low Earth orbit with a perigee of 221 km, an apogee of 1,172 km, an inclination of 48.7 degrees, and an orbital period of 98.7 minutes. It decayed on August 12, 1966.
