    description = Kosmos 48, also known as Zenit-2 24, was a Soviet optical-film return reconnaissance satellite. Kosmos 33 was the twenty-third of eighty-one satellites in this series to be launched. Kosmos 48 was operated in a low Earth orbit; at an epoch of 15 October 1964 it had a perigee of 203 km, an apogee of 282 km, an inclination of 65 degrees, and an orbital period of 89.35 minutes. Midway through its planned reconnaissance mission, Kosmos 48's thermal control system malfunctioned, with the temperature inside the spacecraft's pressurized capsule increasing to 43 degrees Celsius. As a result of the malfunction, the spacecraft was deorbited earlier than had been planned, on October 20, 1964 - six days after launch. The return capsule, containing the cameras and film, was successfully recovered by parachute.
