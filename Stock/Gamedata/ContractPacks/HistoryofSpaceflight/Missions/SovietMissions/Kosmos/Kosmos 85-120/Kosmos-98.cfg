	description = Kosmos 98, also known as Zenit-2 31, was a Soviet optical-film return reconnaissance satellite launched in 1965. Kosmos 98 was the thirty-first of eighty-one satellites in this series to be launched. Kosmos 98 was placed in a low Earth orbit with a perigee of 205 km, an apogee of 547 km, an inclination of 65 degrees, and an orbital period of 92.06 minutes. It conducted an eight day mission before deorbiting and landing by parachute in Siberia.

	notes = Launch the Kosmos 98 reconnaissance satellite into orbit and recover the capsule intact.
