	description = Kosmos-100 was the eighth Russian experimental meteorological satellite and the sixth launched from the Tyuratam site. It was the fifth in a series of prototype satellites. Although the flight was at first thought to be part of the reconnaissance recoverable payload series, it was later revealed that the satellite carried supplemental experiments to test meteorological sensors and to obtain data in support of the operational weather satellite development program. The instrumentation included a cloud cover photometer to measure the brightness characteristics of clouds in the 0.60- to 0.85-micron band, a scanning IR radiometer to determine the angular, spectral, and latitudinal distribution of terrestrial IR radiation in the 0.8 to 45-micron band, a UV spectrophotometer to measure the solar UV radiation reflected and scattered by the earth's atmosphere, and a colorimeter to measure the radiation characteristics of the night air-glow in the 0.25- to 0.60-micron band. The spin-stabilized satellite was in the form of a cylinder with hemispherical ends and was 5 m long and 2.44 m in diameter. It was launched by the Soviet Union.
