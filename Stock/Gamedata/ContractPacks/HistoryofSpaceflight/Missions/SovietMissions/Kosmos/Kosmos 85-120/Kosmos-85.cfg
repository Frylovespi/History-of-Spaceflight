	description = Kosmos 85 was a Soviet optical-film return reconnaissance satellite launched in 1965. Kosmos 85 was a Zenit-4 type Soviet surveillance satellite. The basic design of the Zenit satellites was similar to the Vostok manned spacecraft, sharing the return and service modules. The capsule contained the camera system, its film, recovery beacons, parachutes and a destruct charge. Kosmos 85 was placed in a low Earth orbit with a perigee of 204 km, an apogee of 297 km, an inclination of 65 degrees, and an orbital period of 89.6 minutes. It conducted an eight day reconnaissance mission before deorbiting and landing by parachute in Siberia.

	notes = Launch the Kosmos 85 reconnaissance satellite into a low orbit and recover the capsule intact.
