	description = This early Luna launch was believed to be an attempt to reach the Moon and impact on its surface - the first attempt to reach the Moon surface. A Ye-1 probe was a simple craft: a pressurized spherical object made from aluminum-magnesium alloy, approximately the size of the first Sputnik, that carried five scientific instruments. The goals of the mission were to study the gas component of interplanetary matter (using the proton traps), meteoric particles and photons in cosmic radiation (using the piezoelectric detectors), the magnetic fields of the Moon and Earth (using the magnetometer), variations in cosmic ray intensity, and heavy nuclei in primary cosmic radiation. The probe (on its upper stage) also carried one kilogram of natrium to create an artificial comet on the outbound trajectory that could be photographed from Earth. The third stage engine failed about halfway through its burn, causing the Block E and probe to fall back to the earth. Luna-E3-1 had a mass of 360 kg (including 3rd stage).
