	description = The R-101 was a post-war Russian version of the German Wasserfall surface-to-air missile. It was test flown over 30 times in 2 series of tests, but it was never put into production. The technology gained and lessons learned were used for further surface-to-air and surface-to-surface missile developments in Russia. It had an operational range of 50 km. The R-101's engine produced a thrust of 78.40 kN for 40 seconds.&br;&br;The R-101 had a height of 7.80 m, a diameter of 0.89 m, and a mass of 3,600 kg.
