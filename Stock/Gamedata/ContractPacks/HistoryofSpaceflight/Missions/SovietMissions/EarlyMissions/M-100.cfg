    description = The M-100 sounding rockets were a two-stage, solid propellant, fin stabilized, unguided Russian sounding rocket, fired in greater numbers than any other. At least 6,640 of all models were fired to the edge of space before the vehicle was discontinued in 1990. 4,908 of the basic M-100 model were fired from 1957-1983. The rocket was used to make basic weather soundings on a world-wide basis. A typical flight consists of launch to 90 km altitude, following by the descent of the nosecone under a parachute over a period of 50 minutes. During the descent the payload radioed temperature, pressure, and density data. Below 50 km radar could be used to track the nose cone and determine winds aloft.&br;&br;The M-100 had a mass of 475 kg, a payload of 15.00 kg, a height of 8.34 m, a diameter of 0.25 m, and a max altitude of 90 km.
