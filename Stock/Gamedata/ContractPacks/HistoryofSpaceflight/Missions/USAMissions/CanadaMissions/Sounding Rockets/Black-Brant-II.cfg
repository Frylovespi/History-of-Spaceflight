	description = The performance potential of the Black Brant I motor led to the development of a high altitude research vehicle with improved structural design, nose cone, and fins. This vehicle is known as the Black Brant II. As with the previous version of the rocket, the Black Brant II was a single stage, solid rocket propellant, sounding rocket. There were a total of 58 Black Brant II flights from 1960-1974.&br;&br;The Black Brant II had a height of 8.45 m, a diameter of 0.44 m, and a mass of 980 kg. It had a thrust of 89 kN, and a payload of 68 kg, and a maximum altitude of 275 km. 

	notes = Launch the Black Brant II sounding rocket to an altitude of @/Altitude m and recover the experiment package intact.
	synopsis = <color=yellow>The Black Brant II was first launched on October 12, 1960, at the Fort Churchill Launch site in Manitoba, Canada.</color>
