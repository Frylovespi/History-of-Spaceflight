    description = Terrapin sounding rockets were two-stage vehicles launched from Wallops Island. The Terrapin sounding rocket was developed by Republic Aviation under a National Security Agency contract for a University of Maryland project that allowed graduate students to study the upper atmosphere. The two-stage rocket used a Deacon motor with a slow-burn grain for the lower stage, and a TSI upper stage. The upper stage was equipped with low-drag swept stabilizing fins.&br;&br;The first stage X-220 engine had a thrust of 27.0 kN and burned for 3.0 seconds. The second stage T-55 engine had a thrust of 21.00 kN and burned for 1.30 seconds. Terrapin had a height of 4.50 m, a diameter of 0.16 m, a mass of 101 kg, and could carry a 3.50 kg payload to a max altitude of 130 km.
