    description = To support its missile development program, North American designed and built the NATIV (North American Test Instrument Vehicle) research missile around 1947. The RTV-A-3-NATIV was used to evaluate several aspects of guided missile technology, mainly aerodynamics, propulsion, and general missile handling issues. The first RTV-A-3 launch occurred in May 1948. The RTV-A-3 was powered a liquid-fueled rocket engine producing 11.6 kn of thrust, and used a launch tower for take-off. The airframe design was heavily based on the German Wasserfall surface-to-air missile (prototypes of which were tested near the end of World War II), and as such used four large stabilizing fins with movable flying surfaces for stability and control. The payload of the rocket consisted of a telemetry package to transmit flight performance data to the ground. A total of 4 were launched.&br;&br;The first stage NATIV engine produced 12.00 kN of thrust. The RTV-A-3 Had a length of 4.06m and a diameter of 0.46m. It had a mass of 540 kg and could reach a top speed of Mach 3.2 and a maximum altitude of 19 km. It was designed to reach a downrange distance of around 65 km.
