    description = The Hermes A-2 missile was an American tactical ballistic missile. The Army Hermes A-2 single stage test rocket proved the technology of large solid rocket motors as developed by H L Thackwell at Thiokol. But the Army preferred to have further development done in-house and JPL was selected to develop the Sergeant rocket. In addition to the flight tests, a total of 22 motors were static fired, including one after seven years of storage.&br;&br;Hermes A-2 had a thrust of 142.0 kN, a height of 6.17 m, a diameter of 0.79 m, a mass of 3,530 kg, and a max altitude of 58 km. It had a maximum range of 60 km.
