	description = Nike-Apache was an American sounding rocket. The most popular sounding rocket introduced during the early 1960's was this two-stage, solid-propellant vehicle consisting of a Nike booster and Apache upper stage. The primary difference was the propellant and the phenolic lining of the Apache steel nozzle. The Cajun did not have this lining, and the direct exposure of its steel can to high exhaust temperatures was considered undesirable. The Asp was tried as a replacement for the Cajun but did not prove satisfactory. NASA eventually adopted the Apache, which had already been developed by Thiokol. There were a total of 893 Nike-Apache launches before their retirement in 1980.&br;&br;The first stage M5E1 produced 217.0 kN of thrust for 3.40 seconds, and the second stage TE-307 engine produced 21.0 kN for 6.0 seconds. Nike Apache had a height of 8.31 m, a diameter of 0.42 m, a mass of 728 kg, and an max altitude of 200 km.
