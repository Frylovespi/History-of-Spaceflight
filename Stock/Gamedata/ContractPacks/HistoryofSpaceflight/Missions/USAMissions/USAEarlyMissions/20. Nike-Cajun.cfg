	description = Nike-Cajun was an American sounding rocket. It was a two stage vehicle consisting of a Nike booster together with a Cajun upper stage. Aside from the Soviet MMR-06, the Nike-Cajun was the most often launched sounding rocket. The Cajun motor was developed for NASA in the 1950's by Thiokol, providing a more modern but still affordable replacement for the World War II-era Deacon. A total of 761 Nike-Cajun were launched until their retirement in 1976.&br;&br;The first stage M5E1 produced a thrust of 217.0 kN for 3.40 seconds, and the second stage Cajun engine produced 36.0 kN of thrust for 3.0 seconds. Nike Cajun had a height of 7.70 m, a diameter of 0.42 m, a mass of 698.0 kg, and could reach a max altitude of 120 km.
