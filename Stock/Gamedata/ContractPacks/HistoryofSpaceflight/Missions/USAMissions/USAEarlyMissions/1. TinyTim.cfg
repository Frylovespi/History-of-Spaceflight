	description = The Tiny Tim was an American air-to-ground rocket used near the end of the Second World War. It was built in response to a United States Navy requirement for an anti-shipping rocket capable of hitting ships outside of their anti-aircraft range, with a payload capable of sinking heavy shipping. The Tiny Tim was manufactured using 11.75-inch pipe, which was chosen because it was already being manufactured. Used oil field 11.75-inch pipe was acquired for the prototypes. Also, the 11.75-inch size was of interest in the development because there was already available a 500-pound semi-armor-piercing bomb that was adaptable for use as the warhead for the rocket. One of the rocket project scientists commented on the shortage of the piping that they were reduced for a time to the expedient of salvaging [oil-well casing] from abandoned oil wells. There were 13 Tiny Tims launched for testing before their retirement in May 1946.&br;&br;The Tiny Tim had a payload of 67.40 kg, a thrust of 220.00 kN for 0.6 s, a height of 2.50 m, a diameter of 0.30 m, a mass of 300 kg and a max altitude of 1.5 km.
