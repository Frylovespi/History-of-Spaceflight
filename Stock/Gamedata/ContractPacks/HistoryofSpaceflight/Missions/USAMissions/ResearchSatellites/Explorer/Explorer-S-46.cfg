	description = Explorer S-46 was an American earth magnetosphere satellite. It was a research, ionospheric satellite operated by NASA. Its mission was to analyze electron and proton radiation energies in a highly elliptical orbit. If it had reached orbit, it would have received an Explorer designation. It carried the following experiments: a CDS Proton Detector, an Electron Spectrometer, a High Energy GM Tube and a Medium Energy GM Tube. Launch vehicle telemetry was lost shortly after the first stage burnout and one of the upper stages failed to fire. The spacecraft did not achieve orbit. S-46 had a mass of 15.7 kg.         

	notes = Launch Explorer S-46 and fail to reach orbit due to the second stage failing to ignite.
