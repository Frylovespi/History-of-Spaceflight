    description = Explorer (S-45A) was lost in a launch failure in 1961. The satellite was intended to operate in a highly elliptical orbit, from which it was to have provided data on the shape of the ionosphere, and on the Earth's magnetic field. It was part of the Explorer program, and would have been designated Explorer 12 had it reached orbit. A second identical satellite, S-45, also failed to achieve orbit when it was launched. In this instance, the second stage ignition system malfunctioned, failed to ignite, and the spacecraft did not achieve orbit. This attempt was the final flight of the Juno II spacecraft. Explorer S-45A had a mass of 33.6 kg.
	
	notes = Launch S-45A and fail to reach orbit due to a second stage ignition failure.
	synopsis = Explorer S-45A was launched by a Juno-II on May 24, 1961 from the Cape Canaveral Launch Complex.
