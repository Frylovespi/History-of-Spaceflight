    description = Explorer S45 was an American earth ionospheric satellite. Explorer S45 was launched using a Juno 2 rocket. The satellite was intended to operate in a highly elliptical orbit, from which it was to have provided data on the shape of the ionosphere, and on the Earth's magnetic field. It was part of the Explorer program, and would have been designated Explorer 10 had it reached orbit. A malfunction following booster separation resulted in loss of payload telemetry and the third and fourth stages failed to ignite. The spacecraft did not achieve orbit. Explorer-S45 had a mass of 33.6 kg.
