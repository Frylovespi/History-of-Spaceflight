	description = The P 21-A was a suborbital probe designed to collect nighttime ionospheric data needed to improve Earth-space communications. It carried a continuous-wave propagation experiment to study electron density and associated parameters of the ionosphere; a swept-frequency probe to make measurements of electron density; and an ion trap to determine positive ion concentration. The spacecraft was an 8-sided cone which contained the experiments and transmitters. It was launched on a Scout X-2 (ST-9) and flew to 6291 km altitude and 7040 km downrange from Wallops Station, Virginia in a 97 minute flight. P-21A returned good data on nighttime ionosphere conditions. It described the newly discovered helium layer under nighttime conditions for the first time. It had a mass of 43.0 kg.
