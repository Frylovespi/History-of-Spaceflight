	description = The Discoverer 6 spacecraft consisted of a main satellite body and a separable reentry vehicle containing a recovery capsule. It was designed to test launching techniques, propulsion, communications, orbital performance, engineering, and recovery techniques. The spacecraft was successfully put into a near-polar orbit by the Thor-Agena A booster. The reentry vehicle was separated from the main body as planned and the capsule released over the Pacific Ocean for descent to Earth but was not recovered.
    
	notes = Launch the Discoverer 6 reconnaissance satellite into a polar orbit.
