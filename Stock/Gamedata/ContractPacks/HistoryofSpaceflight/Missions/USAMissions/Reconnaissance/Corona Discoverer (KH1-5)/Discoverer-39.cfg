	description = The final satellite to be called Discoverer, Discoverer 39 was equipped with infrared sensors for measuring both thermal emissions and reflected solar radiation from the earth and its atmosphere. The satellite was probably a continuation of the Discoverer program for optical reconnaissance, but was also used as a secondary science payload. On this flight Discoverer was instrumented for detecting cosmic radiation and micrometeoroid impacts and their effects on spacecraft. The satellite consisted of a cylindrical rocket body approximately 6 m long and 1.5 m in diameter. The spacecraft burned up upon reentering the earth's atmosphere on May 25, 1962.
