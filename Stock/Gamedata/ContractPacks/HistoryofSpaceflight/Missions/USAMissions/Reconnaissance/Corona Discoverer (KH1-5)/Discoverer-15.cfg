	description = Discoverer 15 was an earth-orbiting satellite designed to test spacecraft engineering techniques and to attempt deceleration, reentry through the atmosphere, and recovery from the sea of an instrument package. Instrumentation was identical to that of Discoverer 13, with the addition of external lights (approximately a sixth to seventh magnitude star) for optical tracking from ground camera stations. The cylindrical Agena A stage carried a telemetry system, a tape recorder, receivers for command signals from the ground, a horizon scanner, and a 120-lb recovery capsule that contained biological specimens. The recovery capsule was ejected, but retrieval was not possible due to inclement weather conditions. Discoverer-15 was the final satellite of the KH-1 version in the Corona program.
