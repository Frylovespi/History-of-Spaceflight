	description = Discoverer 10 was a first generation, low resolution Air Force surveillance satellite launched from Vandenberg AFB aboard a Thor Agena-A rocket. The booster began exhibiting abnormal pitch oscillations almost immediately at liftoff and Range Safety sent the destruct command at T+52 seconds when allowable safety margins were exceeded and at an altitude of 6000 meters. Most of the debris fell in and around LC-75. The failure was traced to a malfunction of the Thor's guidance computer due to a suspected unauthorized repair modification.

	notes = Launch Discoverer 10 and destroy the vessel after 52 seconds of flight.
