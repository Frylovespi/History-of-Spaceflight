	description = Discoverer 17 was a USAF photographic surveillance satellite designed to assess how rapidly the Soviet Union was producing long-range bombers and ballistic missiles, and where they were being deployed. It was part of the Corona program which was also used to produce maps and charts for the Department of Defense and other US government mapping programs. The recovery capsule was ejected, reentered the atmosphere, and was retrieved in mid-air near Hawaii by a C-119 aircraft at 14,000 ft altitude after 2.1 days of spaceflight.

	notes = Launch the Discoverer 17 reconnaissance satellite into a polar orbit and recover the film canister intact.
