	description = The Discoverer 7 spacecraft consisted of a main satellite body and a separable reentry vehicle containing a recovery capsule. It was designed to test launching techniques, propulsion, communications, orbital performance, engineering, and recovery techniques. The spacecraft was put into a near-polar orbit, but the power supply inverter providing electricity to the control system did not operate correctly, and Discoverer 7 began tumbling after insertion. The tumbling prevented the reentry vehicle from separating from the Agena and no recovery was attempted. 
   
	notes = Launch the Discoverer 7 reconnaissance satellite into orbit but do not attempt capsule recovery.
	synopsis = <color=yellow>Discoverer 7 was launched by a Thor Agena A on November 7, 1959 from the Vandenberg AFB Launch Complex.</color>
