	description = Discoverer 21, also known as RM-2, was a technology demonstration spacecraft based on an Agena-B. Like Discoverer 19, it carried no film canister. Its purpose was to test whether the rocket engine could be restarted in space, and to test infrared sensors for the Midas program. Discoverer 21 had a mass of 1,110 kg, and remained in orbit until 20 April 1962, when it decayed and reentered the atmosphere.
