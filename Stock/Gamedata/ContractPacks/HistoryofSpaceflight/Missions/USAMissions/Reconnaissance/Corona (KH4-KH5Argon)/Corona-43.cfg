	description = Corona 43 (KH-4 9036) was a Key Hole-4 reconnaissance satellite used by the United States. It acquired imagery intelligence by taking photographs and returning the undeveloped film to earth. It achieved a typical ground-resolution of 7.5m and frame coverage of 308 km x 308 km. Launch and orbital insertion of Discovery 43 was nominal and the spacecraft recorded imagery over its four day orbit. However, the mission was a failure. During air catch, the chute tore loose and the capsule sank. 
	
	notes = Launch the Corona 43 reconnaissance satellite into a polar orbit and fail to recover the film canister.
