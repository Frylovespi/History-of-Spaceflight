	description = Corona (KH-4 9051) was a Key Hole-4 reconnaissance satellite used by the United States. It acquired imagery intelligence by taking photographs and returning the undeveloped film to earth. It achieved a typical ground-resolution of 7.5m and frame coverage of 308 km x 308 km.&br;&br;The Film was returned by a single General Electric return vehicle (SRV, Satellite Return Vehicle). The film canister was recovered 4 days after launch but contained no images due to erratic attitude control on the Agena spacecraft.

    notes = Launch the Corona 59 reconnaissance satellite and recover the film canister after four days in orbit.
