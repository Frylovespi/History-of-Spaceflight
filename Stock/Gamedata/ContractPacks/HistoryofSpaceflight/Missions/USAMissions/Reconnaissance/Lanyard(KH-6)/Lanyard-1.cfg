	description = Codenamed Lanyard, the KH-6 was the unsuccessful first attempt to develop and deploy a high-resolution optical reconnaissance satellite by the United States National Reconnaissance Office. Launches and launch attempts spanned the period from March to July 1963. The project was quickly put together to get imagery of a site near Tallinn suspected of having anti-ballistic missiles. The satellite carried Itek's "E-5" camera developed for the Samos program, which had been cancelled. The camera had a focal length of 1.67 m and could discern objects on the ground 1.8 m in size. The ground swath of the camera was 14 km by 74 km . The satellite had a mass of 1500 kg (including agena), and had a single re-entry vehicle in which exposed film was returned to earth for a mid-air recovery by aircraft. The KH-6 was manufactured by Lockheed and launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base on Thrust Augemented Thor-Agena D rockets.&br;&br;This was the second attempted launch on a Thrust Augmented Thor. The first stage Thrust Augmented Thor performed nominally, but the mission was a failure due to a guidance malfunction on the second stage Agena. The spacecraft failed to achieve orbit and was destroyed on re-entry.
