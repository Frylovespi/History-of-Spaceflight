	description = MIDAS 8 was the third satellite of the MIDAS Series 3 missile defense early warning system. This launch also carried a payload of two ERS piggyback satellites for the US Air Force. The mission was a failure as the Atlas booster malfunctioned&br;&br;ERS 7 and ERS 8 were a continuation of the Environmental Research Satellites Program by the US Air Force. Both satellites contained radiation and micrometeorite experiments. They were destroyed along with MIDAS 8 when the Altas booster malfunctioned.
