	description = Surveyor 4 was the fourth lunar lander in the American unmanned Surveyor program sent to explore the surface of the Moon. After a flawless flight to the moon, radio signals from the spacecraft ceased during the terminal-descent phase, approximately 2.5 min. before touchdown. Contact with the spacecraft was never reestablished, and the mission was lost. The solid fuel retro rocket may have exploded near the end of its scheduled burn. The planned landing target was Sinus Medii (Central Bay) at 0.4 north latitude and 1.33 west longitude.
	
    notes = Launch Surveyor 4 to @targetBody and crash on the surface.
