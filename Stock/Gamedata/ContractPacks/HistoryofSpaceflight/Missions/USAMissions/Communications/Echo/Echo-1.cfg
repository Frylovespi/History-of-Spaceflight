	description = The Echo 1 spacecraft was a 30.48 m diameter balloon of Mylar polyester film 0.5 mil (0.0127 mm) thick. The spacecraft was designed as a passive communications reflector for transcontinental and intercontinental telephone (voice), radio, and television signals. It was fitted with beacon transmitters operating at  107.9-MHz for telemetry purposes. These transmitters were powered by five nickel-cadmium batteries that were charged by 70 solar cells mounted on the balloon. The balloon satellite functioned as a reflector, not a transceiver, so after it was placed in a low Earth orbit a signal could be sent to it, reflected by its surface, and returned to Earth. It had a mass of 66.0 kg.&br;&br;Echo 1 was placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 1,684 km, a perigee of 1,524 km, an inclination of 47.2 degrees, and an orbital period of 118.3 minutes. The mission ended when the spacecraft decayed from orbit on May 24, 1968.
