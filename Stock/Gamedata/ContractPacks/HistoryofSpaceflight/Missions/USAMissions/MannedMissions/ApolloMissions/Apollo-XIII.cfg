	description = Apollo 13 was the seventh manned mission in the American Apollo space program and intended to be the third mission to carry humans to the surface of the Moon, but an explosion of one of the oxygen tanks and resulting damage to other systems resulted in the mission being aborted before the planned lunar landing could take place, after Apollo XIII had entered a hybrid trajectory towards the Moon. With the oxygen stores depleted, the command module was unusable, the mission had to be aborted, and the crew transferred to the lunar module and powered down the command module. The first maneuver following the abort decision was made with the descent propulsion system to place the spacecraft back in a free-return trajectory around the moon. After the spacecraft swung around the moon, another maneuver reduced the coast time back to earth and moved the landing point from the Indian Ocean to the South Pacific. The crew, commander James A. Lovell, Jr., command module pilot John L. Swigert, Jr., and lunar module pilot Fred W. Haise Jr., were returned safely to Earth on 17 April 1970.&br;&br;Before the accident, the S-IVB auxiliary propulsion system made an evasive maneuver after CSM/LM ejection from the S-IVB stage. The S-IVB/IU impacted the lunar surface on April 14 at a speed of 259 meters per second. Impact was 137.1 kilometers from the Apollo 12 seismometer.
