	description = Skylab 3 (also SL-3 and SLM-2) was the second manned mission to the first American space station, Skylab. The mission began July 28, 1973, with the launch of three astronauts on the Saturn IB rocket, and lasted 59 days, 11 hours and 9 minutes. A total of 1,084.7 astronaut-utilization hours were tallied by the Skylab 3 crew performing scientific experiments in the areas of medical activities, solar observations, Earth resources, and other experiments. Maintenance work included installation of a twin pole solar shield on EVA. Leaks in the Apollo CSM thrusters led to NASA preparation of a rescue mission, using an Apollo CSM modified to fit five crewmembers. It was eventually decided to make a landing with the faulty thrusters instead.
	
	notes = Launch the second crew into orbit to visit Skylab and perform science and maintenance while up there.
