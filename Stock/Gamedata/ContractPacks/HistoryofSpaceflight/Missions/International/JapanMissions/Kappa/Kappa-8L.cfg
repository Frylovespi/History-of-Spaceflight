	description = In August 1962 the future ISAS team inaugurated the new Japanese launch site at Kagoshima (now the Uchinoura space center) with a low-altitude AT-150 test rocket followed by the first launch of the Kappa8L. Despite the similar name, the 8L was a much smaller rocket than the Kappa-8 and was an improved version of the Kappa-6H. It consisted of 1-K160 (20.0 kN, 0.16 m diameter) second stage SRB, and 1-K250-6H (34.0 kN, 0.25 m diameter) first stage SRB.&br;&br;The 8L was built partly as a practice run for the development of the Kappa-9M. The rocket was mostly used for atmospheric studies, including sodium vapor releases to measure wind speeds. There were a total of 12 Kappa 8L launches from 1962-1966. Kappa 8L had a a mass of 400 kg, a maximum payload of 25 kg, and could reach an altitude of 200 km.
