    description = Kappa is a family of Japanese sounding rockets, which were built starting from 1956. The Kappa series represented Japan's first large post-war indigenously-developed sounding rockets. They followed the previous Pencil and Baby rocket tests. They eventually led to the Lambda and Mu solid rocket satellite launchers. Kappa-1 had a thrust of 10.0 kN, a mass of 50.0 kg, a height of 2.70 m, a diameter of 0.13 m, and an max altitude of 40 km.

	notes = Launch the Kappa-1 sounding rocket to 40 km altitude and recover the core intact.		 
    synopsis = <color=yellow>Kappa 1 was first flown on September 24, 1956 at the Akita Rocket Range, Honshu Island, Japan.</color>
