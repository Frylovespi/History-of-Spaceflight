	description = The Kappa 10 was a logical evolution of the Kappa-9M, with the thin second stage replaced by a shortened version of the K420H first stage, called the K-420(1/3). The 10 was used for occasional missions for which the 9M was inadequate, especially for astronomical payloads, and was eventually retired in 1980 after 15 flights. It consisted of 1-K420 (45.0 kN, 0.42 m diameter) second stage SRB, and 1-K420H (110.0 kN, 0.42 m diameter) first stage SRB. Kappa-10 had a mass of 1570 kg, a maximum payload of 60 kg, and could reach an altitude of 250 km.
