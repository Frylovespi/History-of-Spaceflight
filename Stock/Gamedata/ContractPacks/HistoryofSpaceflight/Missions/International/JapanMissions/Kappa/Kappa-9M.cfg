	description = For a quarter of a century the Kappa-9M rocket was almost synonymous with Japanese space science research. By far the most productive of the Kappa variants, its 80 flights launched from 1962 - 1988 resulted in many published papers in a variety of fields. It consisted of 1-K250 (43.0 kN, 0.25 m diameter) second stage SRB, and 1-K420H (110.0 kN, 0.42 m diameter) first stage SRB. Kappa-9M had a mass of 1500 kg, a maximum payload of 60 kg, and could reach an altitude of 350 km.
