	description = The Lambda 4S or L-4S was an experimental Japanese expendable carrier rocket. It was produced by Nissan and the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science and launched five times between 1966 and 1970 with Ohsumi technology demonstration satellites. The first four launches failed, however the fifth, launched on 11 February 1970, successfully placed Ohsumi-5, the first Japanese satellite, into orbit. The fourth stage attitude control failed on Lambda-4S1 and the payload failed to reach orbit. The Ohsumi-1 satellite had a mass of 26.0 kg.

	notes = Launch the Lambda 4S and fail to reach orbit.
