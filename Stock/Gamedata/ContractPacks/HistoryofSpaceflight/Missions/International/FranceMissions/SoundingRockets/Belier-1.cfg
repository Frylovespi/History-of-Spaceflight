	description = The Belier 1 sounding rocket, developed by Sud Aviation, with the only or upper stage being variants of the Belier 1 stage powered by a Jericho rocket motor. These were the most significant series of French civilian suborbital rockets. Manufacturing licenses were sold to India and Pakistan, becoming the basis of their rocket industries. There were 18 Belier 1 rockets launched between 1961-1970.\n\nBelier-1 was a single stage solid fuelled rocket, producing a thrust of 20.0 kN, with a maximum payload of 30kg, and a maximum flight altitude of 80km. It had a height of 4.01 m, a diameter of 0.31 m, and a mass of 313 kg.

	notes = Launch the Belier 1 sounding rocket to an altitude of @/Altitude m and recover the experiment package intact.
	synopsis = <color=yellow>Belier 1 was launched on May 24, 1961 at the  Interarmy Special Vehicles Test Centre near Hammaguir, Algeria.</color>
