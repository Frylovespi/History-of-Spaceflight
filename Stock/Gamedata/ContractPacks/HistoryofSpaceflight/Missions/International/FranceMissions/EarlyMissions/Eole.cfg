    description = Eole was a French test vehicle. Second missile developed by Jean-Jacques Barre and end of that lineage. On 17 May 1946 the French DEFA Agency established the LRBA (Ballistics and Aeronautical Research Laboratory). Jean-Jacques Barre was authorized to develop an improved version of his EA 1941 wartime indigenous rocket design on 15 October, 1946. This development was in competition with the Veronique, being developed for LRBA by a German team. All six test flights ended with failure with most of the rockets failing within the first 10 seconds. In two cases the fins fell off, and two other flights resulted in explosions shortly after lift off.&br;&br;Eole had a mass of 3,400 kg and could carry a payload of 275 kg. It's engine produced a thrust of 100.00 kN, a height of 11.02 m, a diameter of 0.80 m, and a payload 680 kg.

    notes = Launch the Eole sounding rocket and suffer a first stage failure 10 seconds after launch.
