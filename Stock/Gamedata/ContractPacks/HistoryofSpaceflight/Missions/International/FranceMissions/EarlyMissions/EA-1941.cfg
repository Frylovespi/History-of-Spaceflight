	description = EA-1941 was the first French liquid fuel rocket. Developed from 1931-1942, and tested in 1945.  Jean-Jacques Barre of the Artillery Technical Service developed a 10 kN liquid oxygen/gasoline engine. The German occupation did not stop work, which continued quietly. Static tests of the first EA 1941 rocket were conducted in 1941-1942 at the Larzac testing range.&br;&br;EA-1941 had a mass of 100 kg. It was designed to carry a 25 kg payload to an altitude of 50 km and a range of 100 km. It had a thrust of 10.00 kN, a length of 2.5 m, and a diameter of 0.2 m.
