	description = In 1958, the WRE also developed a second small vehicle for use in testing the Woomera Range instrumentation. Like its “big brother” Long Tom, Aeolus (named for the Greco-Roman god of the winds) was assembled from surplus British motors: in this case a cluster of seven LAPStar motors for the first stage, with a single Mayfly as a second stage. With a less powerful boost stage, its apogee was not as high as that of Long Tom, but it was capable of carrying payloads, recoverable if required, between 14-64 kg. With the heaviest payloads its apogee was around 76km, but it could take a 14 kg payload to 129km. There were a total of 7 Aeolus flights from 1958-1961&br;&br;The Aeolus was a two stage all solid propellant sounding rocket. The first stage LAPStar motors produced a thrust of 80.0 kN, and the second stage mayfly produced a thrust of 62 kN. The Aeolus had a height of 6.60 m, and a diameter of 0.41 m. 

    notes = Launch the Aeolus sounding rocket to @/Altitude m altitude and recover the experiment package intact.
