	description = The High Altitude Temperature (HAT) vehicle, originally known as High Altitude Test, was the first of the new rockets to become operational. First launched in 1960, it may have been initially used for instrumentation testing, before assuming its permanent research role in measuring the temperature of the upper atmosphere, complementing research being undertaken by the Skylark program and also by its sister HAD. There were a total of 64 HAT flights from 1960-1970&br;&br;The HAT was a two stage all solid propellant sounding rocket. The first was comprised of 2 Demon solid fuel motors, producing a thrust of 60.0 kN, and the second stage LAPstar produced a thrust of 80 kN. The HAT HAT a height of 5.0 m, and a diameter of 0.47 m, and a mass of 300 kg. It could carry a payload of 16 kg to an average altitude of 60 km. 

    notes = Launch the HAT sounding rocket and reach @/Altitude m altitude.
