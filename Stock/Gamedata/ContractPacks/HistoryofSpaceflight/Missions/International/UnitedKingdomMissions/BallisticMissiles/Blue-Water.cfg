	description = The outline of the Blue Water concept was unveiled in 1956: this tactical weapon was to be a large solid propellant rocket with inertial guidance ranging over 50 km. The missile with its launcher had to be transportable by air and land and have a quick launch reaction time. The prime contractor was English Electric, the GW Division of which had developed the Thunderbird SAM and was responsible for the Corporal in the British Army since 1956. The resulting design was for a 1360 kg (3000-lb) rocket, 7.6 m (25-ft) long and 61 cm (2-ft) in diameter, with mid-section wings and large tail fins. Full development started in 1958 and proceeded rapidly with preliminary test vehicle launches at Aberporth and Woomera. The first stage produced 195.5 kN of thrust for 6s and the second stage produced 35.6 kN of thrust for 21s.
