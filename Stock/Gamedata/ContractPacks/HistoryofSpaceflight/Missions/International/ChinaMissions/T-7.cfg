	description = In March 1960 work began on a launch pad for the full-scale T-7 in a mountainous area of Guangde in southern Anhui Province. The launch site was jointly funded by the Chinese Academy of Sciences' (CAS) Institute of Geophysics and the Shanghai Institute for Electromechanical Design. The full-scale T-7 rocket consisted of a liquid-propellant unguided core rocket surrounded by solid fuel boosters.&br;&br;The T-7 had a height of 10.0 m, a diameter of 0.45 m, and a mass of 1,138 kg. It was designed to loft a payload of 25 kg to an altitude of 60 km. 

	notes = Launch the T-7 sounding rocket to an altitude of @/Altitude m and recover the experiment package intact.
	synopsis = <color=yellow>The T-7 was first launched on September 13, 1960, at the Laogang Sounding Rocket launch site in Shanghai, China.</color>
