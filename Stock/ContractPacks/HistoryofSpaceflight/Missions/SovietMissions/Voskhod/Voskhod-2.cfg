         description = Voskhod 2 was launched with two men on board, cosmonauts Pavel I. Belyayev, pilot, and Aleksey A. Leonov, co-pilot. The spacecraft was equipped with an extendable air lock that permitted Leonov's exit into space without having to evacuate the main cabin air. Leonov was the first man to perform an EVA (ExtraVehicular Activity) in space. For this EVA a space suit was donned, and a life-support system was worn in a back pack. The EVA was recorded by a mounted extended TV camera. Leonov also carried a handheld movie camera. The EVA lasted 20 min, during which Leonov experienced tension and euphoria. The flight of Voskhod 2 lasted for 26 hr, and 16 orbits were completed. A manually controlled reentry was performed because of a malfunction of the automatic orientation devices for the retrofire, and the spacecraft landed in a pine forest far north of the target area. After locating the spacecraft, one day was required to cut through the forest and bring the crew out on skis. Voskhod-2 was launched on a Voskhod rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on March 18, 1965.
         synopsis = Launch the Voskhod-2 capsule into space, perform the first spacewalk, and return safely.
