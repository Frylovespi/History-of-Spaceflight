         description = Venera 1 (meaning Venus 1), also known as Venera-1VA No.2 and occasionally in the West as Sputnik 8 was the first spacecraft to fly past Venus, as part of the Soviet Union's Venera programme. Launched in February 1961, it flew past Venus on 19 May of the same year; however, radio contact with the probe was lost before the flyby, resulting in it returning no data. Venera-1 was launched on a Molniya 8K78 rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on February 12, 1961.
