	description = Kosmos 58 was the fifth Russian experimental meteorological satellite and the third launched from the Tyuratam site. It was the second in a series of prototype satellites that eventually led to the orbiting of Russia's first announced experimental weather satellite, Cosmos 122. No official description of the Cosmos 58 flight has ever been released. However, the orbital parameters and configuration of the satellite were so similar to those of Cosmos 122 that it is generally assumed that Cosmos 58 was a precursor to the satellites of the experimental 'Meteor' system. It was launched by the Soviet Union on February 26, 1965. It had a mass of 4400 kg and was launched from a Vostok-2M rocket from the Tyuratam Launch site at the Baikonur Cosmodrome.
