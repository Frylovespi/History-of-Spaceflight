         description = Kosmos 36, also known as DS-MG-No.2, was a technology demonstration satellite instrumented with proton magnetometers to map the earth's magnetic field. This spacecraft, along with Cosmos 26, represented the U.S.S.R. contribution to the IQSY World Magnetic Survey. The shape of the spacecraft was almost an ellipsoid and measured 1.8 m long and 1.2 m in diameter. A boom 3.3 m long was attached from one end of the spacecraft to the magnetometers. It was launched by the Soviet Union on October 24, 1964. It was launched from a Kosmos-2l 63S1 rocket from the Mayak Launch Complex at Kapustin Yar.
