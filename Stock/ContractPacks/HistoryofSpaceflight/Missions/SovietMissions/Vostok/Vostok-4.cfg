	description = Vostok 4 was launched one day after Vostok 3 with cosmonaut Pavel R. Popovich on board. The spacecraft consisted of a nearly spherical cabin covered with ablative material. There were three small portholes and external radio antennas. Radios, a life support system, instrumentation, and an ejection seat were contained in the manned cabin. This cabin was attached to a service module that carried chemical batteries, orientation rockets, the main retro system, and added support equipment for the total system. This module was separated from the manned cabin on reentry. The flight lasted 70.7 hr, and was in an orbit close to Vostok 3. Minimum distance between the two spacecraft was approximately 5 km. Radio communications were maintained between the two spacecraft and earth during this flight. For the first time, TV pictures were transmitted from the spacecraft and broadcast by the Soviet TV system. A series of scientific and biomedical experiments wwas also performed. The spacecraft landed in the Karaganda region on August 15. Vostok-4 was launched on a Vostok-8K72 rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on August 12, 1962.
