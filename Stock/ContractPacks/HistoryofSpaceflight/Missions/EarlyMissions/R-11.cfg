         description = The R-11 Zemlya, GRAU index 8A61 was a Soviet tactical ballistic missile. It is also known by its NATO reporting name SS-1 Scud-A. It was the first of several similar Soviet missiles to be given the reporting name Scud. The R-11 originated from a 1951 requirement for a ballistic missile with similar performance to the German V-2 rocket, but half its size. With the Wasserfall, an anti-aircraft version of the V-2, as a model the R-11 was developed by engineer Victor Makeev, who was then working in OKB-1, headed by Sergey Korolyov. The two men agreed on the use of RP-1 as the fuel, but disagreed over which oxidizer to use, with Korolev favoring the use of liquid oxygen, while Makeev advocated the use of a storable but toxic oxidizer. The R-11 had a height of 10.6m, a diameter of 0.85m, a 400 kg payload, and a range of 180 km. It was first launched on April 18, 1953.
