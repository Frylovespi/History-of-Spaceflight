	description = Discoverer 35 (1961 Alpha Zeta) program objectives were to evaluate refinements in design changes to prior spacecraft. The spacecraft was also one of a series used by the USAF for low resolution photo surveillance. Special measuring devices were on board to telemeter voltages, pressures, and other performance factors in addition to normal telemetry equipment. The reentry capsule was ejected after 18 orbits and was recovered in mid-air by a C-130 aircraft at 13,000 ft. It was launched on November 15, 1961 aboard a Thor-Agena-B booster from Vandenberg AFB.
