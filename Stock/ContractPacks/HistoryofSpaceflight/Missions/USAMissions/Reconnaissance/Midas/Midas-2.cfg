         description = The MIDAS 2 (Missile Defense Alarm System) satellite was an earth-orbiting satellite designed to measure IR background and define IR sources. In addition, the satellite carried experiments to measure cosmic radiation, atmospheric density, thermal emission and reflected solar radiation from the earth, and micrometeorites. A plasma probe was included too. The spacecraft weighed 2268 kg (including the second stage) and was chemical-battery powered. IR radiation data were received for the lifetime of the battery pack, which powered the final transmission on May 26, 1960. It had a mass of 2300.0 kg (including agena stage) and was launched from an Atlas-Agena A rocket from the Cape Canaveral launch site on May 24, 1960.
