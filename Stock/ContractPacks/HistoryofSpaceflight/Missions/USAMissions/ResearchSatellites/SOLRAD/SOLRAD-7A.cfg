         description = This solar X-ray monitoring satellite was launched in January 1964. It was equipped with ionization chambers to cover the ranges 1-8 A, 8-12 A, and 44-60 A. It was placed into orbit by an Agena D launch vehicle, with its spin axis roughly perpendicular to the sun-satellite direction with an initial spin rate of about 2 cps. The satellite was constructed so that the moments of inertia favored stable rotation about the spin axis; however, the magnetic brooms produced varying torques by interacting with the earth's magnetic field. This resulted in a slow precession of the spin axis. It had a mass of 39.0 kg and was launched from a Thorad-Agena D rocket from the Vandenberg AFB launch site on January 11, 1964.
