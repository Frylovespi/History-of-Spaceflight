         description = Vanguard Satellite Launching Vehicle 5 (SLV-5) was designed to place two satellites in orbit, a 33 cm (13 inch) diameter sphere (Sphere A) equipped with a magnetometer, and a 76 cm (30 inch) diameter aluminum-coated inflatable sphere (Sphere B), containing no instrumentation, for optical tracking. Launched in April 1959, the mission failed when the second stage failed to operate following first-stage separation. The satellites and third stage tumbled into the Atlantic Ocean several hundred kilometers off the coast after about 500 seconds of flight. Vanguard-SLV-5 was launched on April 14, 1959 at the Atlantic Missile Range in Cape Canaveral, Florida.
