The main purpose of the Vanguard Test Vehicle launchings was systems testing for the launch vehicle and satellite. The program objectives for the satellite were to conduct solar X-ray and space environment measurements from Earth orbit. The IGY Vanguard satellite program was designed with the purpose of launching one or more Earth orbiting satellites during the International Geophysical Year (IGY). Vanguard-TV5 was launched on April 29, 1958 at the Atlantic Missile Range in Cape Canaveral, Florida.
