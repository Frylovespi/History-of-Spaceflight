         description = Biosatellite 2 carried 13 experiments to conduct biological experiments in low earth orbit. Reentry was initiated 17 orbits early because of communications difficulties and a storm in the recovery area. It had a mass of 955.0 kg and was launched from an Thor-Delta G rocket from the Cape Canaveral launch site on September 7, 1967.
