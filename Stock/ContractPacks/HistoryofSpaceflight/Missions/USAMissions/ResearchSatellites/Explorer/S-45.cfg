         description = S-45 was an American earth ionospheric satellite. Explorer (S-45) was launched using a Juno 2 rocket. Its mission was to investigate the shape of the ionosphere. A malfunction following booster separation resulted in loss of payload telemetry and the third and fourth stages failed to ignite. The spacecraft did not achieve orbit. S-45 had a mass of 33.6 kg. It launched atop a Juno-II rocket on February 24, 1961 from the Cape Canaveral launch site.
