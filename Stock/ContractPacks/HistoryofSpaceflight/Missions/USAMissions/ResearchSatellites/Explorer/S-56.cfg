         description = S-56 was a 3.7 m sphere intended to determine the density of the earth's atmosphere. It was the first attempt to place a satellite in orbit using an all-solid propellant launch vehicle and the first orbital attempt made from NASA's Wallops Island facility. The second stage failed to ignite and the spacecraft did not achieve orbit, impacting in the Atlantic Ocean, 130 km east of Wallops Island. An identically configured launch vehicle with an identical satellite was successfully launched two months later (Explorer 9, 1961-004A). S-56 had a mass of 6.3 kg. It launched atop a Scout rocket on December 4, 1960 from the Wallops Island launch site.
