         description = S-46A was an American earth magnetosphere satellite. Explorer. Research, ionospheric satellite operated by NASA. Its mission was to analyze electron and proton radiation energies in a highly elliptical orbit. If it hat reached orbit, it would have received an Explorer designation. It carried the following experiments: a CDS Proton Detector, an Electron Spectrometer. a High Energy GM Tube and a Medium Energy GM Tube. Launch vehicle telemetry was lost shortly after the first stage burnout and one of the upper stages failed to fire. The spacecraft did not achieve orbit. S-46A had a mass of 15.7 kg. It launched atop a Juno-II rocket on March 23, 1960 from the Cape Canaveral launch site.
