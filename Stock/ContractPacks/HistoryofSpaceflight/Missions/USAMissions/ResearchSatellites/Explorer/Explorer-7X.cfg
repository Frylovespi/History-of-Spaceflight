         description = Explorer 7X (S-1) was launched at 16:37 UT on 16 July 1959 from the Atlantic Missile Range in Cape Canaveral, Florida on a Juno 2 rocket. It was destroyed by the Range Safety Officer 5.5 seconds after liftoff when it tilted sharply because of a failure of the power supply to the guidance system. The satellite was nearly identical to the later successfully launched Explorer 7. It had a mass of 41.5 kg. It launched atop a Juno-II rocket on July 16, 1959 from the Cape Canaveral launch site.
