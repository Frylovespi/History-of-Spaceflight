         description = Explorer (S-55), also known as Meteoroid Sat A, was launched using a Scout 5 rocket from the Wallops Flight Facility. Its mission was to evaluate the launch vehicle, and investigate micrometeoroid impact and penetration. The mission failed because the third stage failed to ignite and the spacecraft did not achieve orbit. S-55 had a mass of 84.4 kg. It launched atop a Scout rocket on June 30, 1961 from the Wallops Island launch site.
