         description = Explorer 11, also known as S 15, was launched for the purpose of detecting the sources of high-energy gamma rays. It carried the first space-borne gamma-ray telescope. This was the earliest beginning of space gamma-ray astronomy. In addition to detecting gamma rays, Explorer 11 was designed to map their direction with emphasis on the plane of the galaxy, the galactic center, the sun, and other known radio noise sources; to relate the measurements to the cosmic-ray flux density and the density of interstellar matter; and to measure the high-energy gamma-ray albedo of the earth's atmosphere. It had a mass of 37.2 kg. It launched atop a Juno-II rocket on April 27, 1961 from the Cape Canaveral launch site.
