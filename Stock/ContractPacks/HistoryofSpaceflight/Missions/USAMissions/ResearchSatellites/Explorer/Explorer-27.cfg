	description = Explorer 27 (BE-C) was a small ionospheric research satellite instrumented with an electrostatic probe, radio beacons, a passive laser tracking reflector, and a Doppler navigation experiment. Its primary objective was to obtain worldwide observations of total electron content between the spacecraft and the earth. The satellite was initially spin stabilized, but it was despun after solar paddle erection. Subsequent stabilization oriented the satellite axis of symmetry with the local magnetic field by means of a strong bar magnet and damping rods. A three-axis magnetometer and sun sensors provided information on the satellite attitude and spin rate. It had a mass of 60.8 kg and was launched from a Scout rocket from the Wallops Island launch site on April 29, 1965.
