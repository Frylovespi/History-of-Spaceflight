         description = The Navy Transit 3B contained a navigation payload experiment. It demonstrated the feasiblity of using satellites as navigational aids. Transit spacecraft were developed for updating the inertial navigation systems on board US Navy Polaris submarines, and later for civilian use. The receivers used the known characteristics of the satellites orbit, measured the Doppler shift of the satellites radio signal, and thereby calculated the receivers position on the earth. It was launched from a Thor-Ablestar rocket from the Cape Canaveral launch site on February 22, 1961.
