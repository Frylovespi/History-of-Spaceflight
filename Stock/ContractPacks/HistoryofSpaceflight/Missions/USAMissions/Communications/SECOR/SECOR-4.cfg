         description = SECOR 4 was a small geodetic satellite used to precisely determine points on the earth. It was launched from the WSMC as a joint venture of the US Army and Navy to locate Pacific islands. Experiments with these led to Timation, and finally to the GPS Navstar system. It had a mass of 18.0 kg and was launched from a Thorad-Agena D rocket from the Vandenberg AFB launch site on May 3, 1965.
