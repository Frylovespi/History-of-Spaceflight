         description = ANNA 1B (acronym for "Army, Navy, NASA, Air Force") was a US Navy geodetic satellite. The mission consists of ANNA serving as a reference for making precise geodetic surveys, allowing measurement of the force and direction of the gravitational field of the Earth, locating the middle of land masses and establishing surface positions. ANNA 1B was spherically shaped with a diameter of 0.91 meters and a weight of 161 kg. It was powered by a band of solar cells located around its equator supported by nickel-cadmium batteries. A communications antenna was wrapped around the spiral surface of the satellite. It was launched aboard a Thor-Ablestar rocket on October 31, 1962 from the Cape Canaveral launch site.
