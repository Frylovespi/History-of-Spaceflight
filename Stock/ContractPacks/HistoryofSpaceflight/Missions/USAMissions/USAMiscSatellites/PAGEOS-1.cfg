	description = The PAGEOS (Passive Geodetic Earth Orbiting Satellite) spacecraft was a 30.48-m inflatable sphere, and had no instrumentation on board. It was the second (following GEOS 1) NASA satellite in the National Geodetic Satellites Program. The primary purpose of the satellite was to provide a tracking target for geodetic purposes. It had a specular reflectance of 0.862, and a diffuse reflectance of 0.029, providing a reflecting light source whose brightness was relatively independent of observer-satellite-sun phase angle. It had a mass of 56.7 kg and was launched from a Thorad-Agena D rocket from the Vandenberg AFB launch site on June 24, 1966.
