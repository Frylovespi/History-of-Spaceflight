         description = Beacon Explorer-A was a small ionospheric research satellite instrumented with an electrostatic probe, a 20-, 40-, and 41-Hz ionospheric radio beacon, a passive laser tracking reflector, and a navigation experiment. Its primary objective was to obtain worldwide observations of total electron content between the spacecraft and the earth. The spacecraft was an octagonal right prism (24.5-cm high x 45.7-cm diam) terminated on top with a truncated octagonal pyramid on which the laser reflectors were mounted. Appended were four hinged paddles carrying solar cells. Each paddle was 167.6 x 25.4 cm. During the third stage operation, a malfunction of unidentified origin prevented successful orbit. Satellite and third stage descent were in the south Atlantic with no useful scientific data obtained. It had a mass of 114.0 kg and was launched atop a Thor-Delta rocket from the Cape Canaveral launch site on March 19, 1964.
