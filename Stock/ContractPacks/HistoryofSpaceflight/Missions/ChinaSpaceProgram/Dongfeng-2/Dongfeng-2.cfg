         description = The second type of missile produced for China's space program was the Dongfeng 2 missile (DF-2). Many western observers believed that it was a copy of the Soviet R-5 Pobeda (SS-3 Shyster) medium-range ballistic missile, having identical looks, range, engine, and payload. The DF-2 had a single RD-103M rocket engine, and used alcohol for fuel with liquid oxygen (LOX) as an oxidizer. The DF-2 had a maximum range of 1200km and carried a 1375kg payload.
