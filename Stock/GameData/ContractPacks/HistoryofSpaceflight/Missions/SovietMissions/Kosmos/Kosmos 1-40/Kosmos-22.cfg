	description = Kosmos 22, also known as Zenit-2 14, was a Soviet optical-film return reconnaissance satellite. Kosmos 22 was the fourteenth of eighty-one satellites in this series to be launched. It was launched on a Voskhod rocket from Site 1/5 of the Baikonur Cosmodrome on November 16, 1963.&br;&br;Kosmos 22 was placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 381 km, a perigee of 192 km, and an inclination of 65 degrees. It conducted a five day mission before deorbiting and landing by parachute on November 21, 1963.
