	description = Kosmos 34, also known as Zenit-4 3, was a Soviet Zenit-4 series optical-film return reconnaissance satellite launched on a Voskhod 11A57 rocket from Site 1/5 of the Baikonur Cosmodrome on July 1, 1964. The spacecraft had a mass of 4,730 kg.&br;&br;Kosmos 34 was placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 348 km, a perigee of 202 km, an inclination of 65 degrees and an orbital period of 90 minutes. It conducted an eight day mission before deorbiting and landing by parachute in Siberia on July 9, 1964.
