	description = Kosmos 33, also known as Zenit-2 19, was a Soviet optical-film return reconnaissance satellite launched in 1964 by a Vostok-2 from Site 31/6 of the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Kosmos 32 was the nineteenth of eighty-one satellites in the Zenit-2 series to be launched. The spacecraft had a mass of 4,730 kg.&br;&br;Kosmos 33 was placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 293 km, a perigee of 209 km, an inclination of 65 degrees, and an orbital period of 89.4 minutes. It conducted an eight day mission before deorbiting and landing by parachute in Siberia on July 1, 1964.

	notes = Launch the Kosmos 33 reconnaissance satellite into orbit and recover the capsule after 8 days.
