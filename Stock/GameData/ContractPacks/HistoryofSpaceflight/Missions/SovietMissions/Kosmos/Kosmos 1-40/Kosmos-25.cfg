	description = Kosmos 25, also known as DS-P1 4, was a prototype radar target satellite for anti-ballistic missile tests launched by the Soviet Union on February 27, 1964. It was the last of the four launches of the Dnepropetrovsk Sputnik (DS-P1) prototype satellite program. Its primary mission was to demonstrate the necessary technologies for radar tracking of spacecraft, which would allow future satellites to function as targets. Kosmos 25 had a mass of 355.0 kg and was launched on a Kosmos-2l 63S1 from Pad 2 of the Mayak Launch Complex at Kapustin Yar.&br;&br;Kosmos 25 was placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 526 km, a perigee of 255 km, an inclination of 49 degrees, and an orbital period of 92.3 minutes. It decayed from orbit on November 21, 1964.
