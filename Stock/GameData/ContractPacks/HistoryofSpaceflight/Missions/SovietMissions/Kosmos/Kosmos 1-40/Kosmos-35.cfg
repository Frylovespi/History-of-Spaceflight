	description = Kosmos 35, also known as Zenit-2 20, was an optical-film return reconnaissance satellite launched by a Vostok-2 on July 15, 1964 from Site 31/6 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in the Soviet Union. Kosmos 32 was the twentieth of eighty-one satellites in the Zenit-2 series to be launched It had a mass of 4,730 kg.&br;&br;Kosmos 35 was placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 258 km, a perigee of 218 km, an inclination of 57.3 degrees, and an orbital period of 89.2 minutes. It conducted an eight day mission before deorbiting and landing by parachute in Siberia on July 23, 1964.
