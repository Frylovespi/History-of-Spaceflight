	description = Kosmos 23, also known as Omega 2, was a prototype experimental Omega type satellite of the Dnepropetrovsk Sputnik series. It was a 200 km spacecraft, built by the Yuzhnoye Design Bureau, and was used to conduct experiments with the use of gyroscopes to control spacecraft, for VNIIEM. Kosmos 23 was launched by the Soviet Union on a Kosmos-2l 63S1 from pad 2 of the Mayak Launch Complex at Kapustin Yar on December 14, 1963.&br;&br;Kosmos 23 was placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 540 km, a perigee of 241 km, an inclination of 49 degrees, and an orbital period of 92.3 minutes. It decayed from orbit on March 27, 1964.
