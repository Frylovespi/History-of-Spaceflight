	description = Kosmos 20, also known as Zenit-2 13, was a Soviet optical-film return reconnaissance satellite launched in 1963. Kosmos 20 was the thirteenth of eighty-one satellites in this series to be launched. It was launched on a Vostok-2 rocket from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome on October 18, 1963.&br;&br;Kosmos 20 was placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 296 km, a perigee of 202 km, and inclination of 64.8 degrees, and an orbital period of 89.49 minutes. It conducted an eight day mission before deorbiting and landing by parachute eight days later on October 26, 1963.
