	description = Kosmos 29, also known as Zenit-2 19, was a Zenit-2 optical-film return reconnaissance satellite launched by the Soviet Union on a Vostok-2 from Site 1/5 of the Baikonur Cosmodrome in 1964. Kosmos 29 was the sixteenth of eighty-one satellites in this series to be launched. The Zenit-2 spacecraft had a mass of 4,780 kg.&br;&br;Kosmos 29 was placed in a low Earth orbit on April 25, 1964 at 10:19 UTC, with an apogee of 295 km, a perigee of 202 km, an inclination of 65 degrees, and an orbital period of 89.47 minutes. It conducted an eight day mission before deorbiting and landing by parachute in Siberia on May 3, 1964.
