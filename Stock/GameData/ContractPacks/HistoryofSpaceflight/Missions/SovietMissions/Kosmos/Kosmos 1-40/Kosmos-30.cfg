	description = Kosmos 30, also known as Zenit-4 2, was a test flight of a second generation optical-film return reconnaissance satellite. It was launched by the Soviet Union aboard a Voskhod rocket launched from Site 1/5 of the Baikonur Cosmodrome Launch Complex on May 18, 1964. Kosmos 30 was the second prototype Zenit-4 to attempt to be launched. Once operational this satellite will be launched by the future Soyuz spacecraft.&br;&br;Kosmos 30 was placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 366 km, a perigee of 205 km, an inclination of 64.9 degrees, and an orbital period of 90.2 minutes. It conducted an eight day mission before deorbiting and landing by parachute on May 26, 1964.
