	description = Kosmos 17, also known as DS-A1 2, was a technology demonstration and radiation research satellite launched by the Soviet Union on April 13, 1963. Its primary mission was to test technology for future Soviet spacecraft. It also conducted radiation experiments. It had a mass of 322.0 kg and was launched from a Kosmos-2l 63S1 rocket from pad 2 at the Mayak Launch Complex at Kapustin Yar.&br;&br;Kosmos 17 was placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 788 km, a perigee of 260 km, an inclination of 49 degrees, and an orbital period of 94.8 minutes.
