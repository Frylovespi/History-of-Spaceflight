	description = Kosmos 32, also known as Zenit-2 18, was a Soviet optical-film return reconnaissance satellite launched on a Vostok-2 rocket by the Soviet Union on June 10, 1964. It was launched from Site 31/6 of the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Kosmos 32 was the Eighteenth of eighty-one satellites in the Zenit-2 series to be launched. The spacecraft had a mass of 4,730 kg.&br;&br;Kosmos 32 was placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 319 km, a perigee of 213 km, an inclination of 51.3 degrees, and an orbital period of 89.8 minutes. It conducted an eight day mission before deorbiting and landing by parachute in Siberia on June 18, 1964.
