	description = Kosmos 18, also known as Zenit-2 11, was a Soviet optical-film return reconnaissance satellite launched by the Soviet Union on April 28, 1963. Kosmos 18 was the tenth of eighty-one satellites in this series to be launched. It was launched on a Vostok-2 (sn: E15000-12) at Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome.&br;&br;Kosmos 18 was placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 278 km, a perigee of 203 km, an inclination of 64.9 degrees, and an orbital period of 89.31 minutes. It   conducted a ten day mission and then was deorbited and landed by parachute on June 2, 1963.
