	description = Kosmos 14, also known as Omega 1, was a technology demonstration and research satellite launched by the Soviet Union on April 13, 1963 at the Mayak Launch Complex at Kapustin Yar. Kosmos 14 was an Omega satellite, derived from the Dnepropetrovsk Sputnik series. It had a mass of 200 kg, and was built by the Yuzhnoye Design Bureau. It was used by VNIIEM to conduct experiments with the use of gyroscopes to control spacecraft.&br;&br;Kosmos 14 was the first of two omega satellites to be launched. Kosmos 14 was placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 435 km, a perigee of 253 km, an inclination of 49 degrees, and an orbital period of 91.3 minutes. It decayed from orbit on August 29, 1963.
