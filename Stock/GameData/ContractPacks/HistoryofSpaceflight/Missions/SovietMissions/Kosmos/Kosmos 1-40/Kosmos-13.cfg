	description = Kosmos 13, also known as Zenit-2 No.9, was the sixth Soviet reconnaissance satellite to successfully reach orbit. It was a Zenit-2 spacecraft, and the eighth of eighty-one such satellites to be launched. It had a mass of 4,730 kg, and was launched on a Vostok-2 rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on March 21, 1963. It conducted an eight day mission and was then deorbited and landed by parachute.&br;&br;Kosmos 13 was placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 317 km, a perigee of 201 km, an inclination of 64.9 degrees, and an orbital period of 89.69 minutes.
