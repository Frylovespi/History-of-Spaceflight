	description = Kosmos 24, also known as Zenit-2 No.15, was a Soviet optical-film return reconnaissance satellite. Kosmos 24 was the fifteenth of eighty-one satellites in this series to be launched. It was launched on a Vostok-2 rocket from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome on December 19, 1963.&br;&br;Kosmos 24 was placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 391 km, a perigee of 204 km, an inclination of 65 degrees, and an orbital period of 90.5 minutes. It conducted a nine day mission before deorbiting and landing by parachute in Siberia December 28, 1963.
