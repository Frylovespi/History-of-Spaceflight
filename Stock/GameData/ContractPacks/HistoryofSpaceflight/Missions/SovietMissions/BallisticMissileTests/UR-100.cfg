        description = The UR-100 was a two-stage liquid-propellant lightweight ICBM. It was the Soviet answer to the US Minuteman and was deployed in larger numbers than any other in history. Initial versions carried a single warhead of 0.5 to 1.1 Mt yield, while later versions could carry three or six MIRV warheads. The missile was silo-launched. 15P784 silo design (by KBOM, Design Bureau of Common Machinery, of V.P.Barmin) was greatly simplified in comparison to earlier missiles. Facilities consisted of hardened, un-manned silos controlled by a single central command post. This was the first soviet ICBM (8K84M, entered service on 3 October 1971) equipped with missile defense countermeasure "Palma" by NII-108 of V.Gerasimenko. The UR-100 had a range up to 11,000 km with a light (770 kg) warhead, and a range of 4,000 km with a heavy (1,750 kg) warhead. &br;&br; Payload: 770 - 1750 kg&br; Gross mass: 41,410 kg&br; Thrust: 785 kN&br; Height: 16.93 m&br; Diameter: 2.00 m&br; Max Apogee: 1,000 km.
