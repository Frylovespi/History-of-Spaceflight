	description = Soyuz 38 was a human spaceflight mission conducted by the Soviet Union during September, 1980. The Soyuz spacecraft brought two visiting crew members to the Salyut 6 space station, one of whom was an Intercosmos cosmonaut from Cuba. It was the 12th expedition to Salyut 6 and the 7th international crew. The Soyuz 38 docking occurred in darkness. As the spacecraft approached Salyut 6, the Dniepers could see only its “headlights.” Ryumin filmed ignition and operation of the transport's main engine. Scientific work to find reasons of the space adaptation syndrome of the crew together with the fourth resident crew was done. Other goals were Earth observation, solar observation and plant growing experiments, crystal growing experiments.
