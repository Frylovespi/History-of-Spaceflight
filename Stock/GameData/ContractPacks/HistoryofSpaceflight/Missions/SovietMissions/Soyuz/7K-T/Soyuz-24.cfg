	description = Soyuz 24 was a 1977 Soviet mission to the Salyut 5 space station, the third and final mission to the station, the last purely military crew for the Soviets and the final mission to a military Salyut. Cosmonauts Viktor Gorbatko and Yuri Glazkov re-activated the station after toxic fumes had apparently terminated the mission of Soyuz 21, the previous crew. They performed biological and materials experiments while on board. Other presumed activities included photographic reconnaissance, and finishing tasks the previous crew was forced to abandon when their mission abruptly ended. The Soyuz 24 crew landed after spending nearly 18 days in space, and the Salyut station was de-orbited six months later.&br;&br;On 21 February, the crew performed an air-changing experiment, shown on TV, slowly venting air from one end of the station to the other while releasing 100 kg of air from tanks in the docked Soyuz orbital module. This was a test of the future air replenishment techniques to be carried out with Progress transports in subsequent space stations. They began to activate the Soyuz on 23 February, deactivate the space station, and undocked and landed near Arkalyk on 25 February. The Soyuz landed in a blowing snowstorm and recovery crews could not locate the capsule. As it turned out, the search and rescue beacon was unable to deploy due to being jammed shut from snow, so Berezovoy had to free it by hand. The next day, the Salyut released a capsule which was recovered on Soviet territory, containing exposed film and experiments carried out by the two crews who crewed the station. The station itself was deorbited on 8 August.
