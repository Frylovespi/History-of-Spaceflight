	description = Soyuz 26 was a Soviet space mission which launched the crew of Salyut 6 EO-1, the first long duration crew on the space station Salyut 6. The Soyuz spacecraft was launched on 10 December 1977, and docked with the space station the next day. Soyuz 27 arrived at the station in January 1978, and its two-person crew transferred into the Soyuz 26 spacecraft to undock and land a few days later.&br;&br;An SEVA was performed by Yuri Romanenko and Georgi Grechko on December 19, 1977 (1h 28m), inspecting the Salyut 6 docking port. The inspection confirmed that the Soyuz 25 spacecraft docking unit was at fault in its failure to hard dock, and that its docking attempts had left the Salyut 6 front port undamaged. It was later revealed that a potentially dangerous incident occurred during the EVA. Once Georgi Grechko was back in the airlock, Yuri Romanenko asked to look outside, so Georgi Grechko moved aside and Yuri Romanenko pushed hard against the airlock. He did not have his safety tether attached and began to float away from the station and thrash about. Georgi Grechko grabbed his Commander by his untethered safety line and pulled him back in.
