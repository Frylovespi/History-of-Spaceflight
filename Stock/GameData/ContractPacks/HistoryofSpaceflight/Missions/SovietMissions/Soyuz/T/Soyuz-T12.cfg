	description = Soyuz T-12 was the seventh crewed spaceflight to the Soviet space station Salyut 7. The mission occurred in July 1984, during the long-duration expedition Salyut 7 EO-3. On July 25 Dzhanibekov and Savitskaya performed a 3 hr, 30 min EVA (Savitskaya became the first woman ever to perform EVA), during which they tested the URI multipurpose tool. They cut, welded, soldered, and coated metal samples. During the Pamirsâ€™ stay, the six cosmonauts aboard Salyut 7 also conducted Rezonans tests and collected station air samples. The potential Buran Space shuttle pilot, Igor Volk, was given spaceflight experience. Unlike many Soyuz visiting missions, the Soyuz lifeboats were not swapped, and the crew returned to Earth in the same spacecraft in which they launched.
