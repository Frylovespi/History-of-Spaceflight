	description = Venera 7, also designated 4V-1 No. 630, was the first probe designed to survive Venus's surface conditions and to make a soft landing. Massively overbuilt to ensure survival, it had few experiments on board, and scientific output from the mission was further limited due to an internal switchboard failure that stuck in the "transmit temperature" position. Still, the control scientists succeeded in extrapolating the pressure (90 atm) from the temperature data with 465 °C (869 °F), which resulted from the first direct surface measurements. The spacecraft was very similar in design to Venera 5 and 6, with a bus holding a spherical lander probe.&br;&br;The Venera 7 probe separated from the bus and entered the nightside atmosphere of Venus on December 15, 1970. After aerodynamic braking, the top hatch was blown and the parachute system was deployed at about 60 km altitude. Six minutes later the parachute ripped, and then collapsed, leaving the probe to fall towards the surface for another 29 minutes. The probe impacted on the Venus surface at about 17 meters/sec and the signals weakened, reached full strength for about one second, and then seemingly ceased. Later analysis of the recorded radio signals revealed that the probe had survived the impact and continued transmitting a weak signal for another 23 minutes. It is believed that the spacecraft may have bounced upon impact and come to rest on its side, so the antenna was not pointed towards Earth.
