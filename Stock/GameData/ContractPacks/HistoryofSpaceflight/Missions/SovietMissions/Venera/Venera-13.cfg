	description = Venera 13, also designated 4V-1 No.760, was part of another dual mission to Venus, paired with Venera 14, launched in autumn 1981. Both spacecraft carried identical instrumentation and were very similar to Venera 9-12. As with Venera 11 and 12, the flight platform continued on past Venus into a heliocentric orbit, after ejection of the lander probe. Near encounter with Venus occurred on March 1, 1982. Venera 13 transmitted the first recording of actual sounds from another planet which included sounds of Venusian wind, lander hitting the ground, pyrotechnic lens cap removal and its impact on regolith, and action of the regolith drilling apparatus.

	notes = Launch the Venera 13 spacecraft and achieve intact landing on solid ground on @/targetBody, transmitting data from its surface.
	synopsis = <color=yellow>Venera 13 was launched by a Proton-K Blok-D-1 on October 30, 1981 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome.</color>
