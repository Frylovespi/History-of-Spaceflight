	description = Venera 5, also designated 2V (V-69) No. 330, was similar in design to Venera 3 & 4, although it was of a stronger design, identical to its twin Venera 6. The Venera 5 and Venera 6 spacecraft were launched 5 days apart in January 1969. The spacecraft were designed to make in-situ measurements as they descended through the Venusian atmosphere. Measurements included temperature, pressure, composition.&br;&br;The probe was released from the bus on 16 May 1969 at a distance of 37,000 km from Venus. The probe entered the nightside atmosphere at 06:01 UT and when the velocity slowed to 210 m/sec the parachute deployed and transmissions to Earth began. The probe sent read-outs every 45 seconds for 53 minutes before finally succumbing to the temperature and pressure at roughly 320 C, 26.1 bar, at 24 to 26 km altitude over 3 degrees S, 18 degrees E.
