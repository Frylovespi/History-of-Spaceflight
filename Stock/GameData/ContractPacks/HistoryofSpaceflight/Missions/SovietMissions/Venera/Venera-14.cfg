	description = Venera 14, also designated 4V-1 No.761, was part of another dual mission to Venus, paired with Venera 13, launched in autumn 1981. Both spacecraft carried identical instrumentation and were very similar to Venera 9-12. As with Venera 11 and 12, the flight platform continued on past Venus into a heliocentric orbit, after ejection of the lander probe. Near encounter with Venus occurred on March 5, 1982. The lander had cameras to take pictures of the ground and spring-loaded arms to measure the compressibility of the soil. The quartz camera windows were covered by lens caps that popped off after descent. By mischance Venera 14 measured the compressibility of the lens caps instead, as these had landed in just the place where the probe craned down to measure the soil.

	notes = Launch the Venera 14 spacecraft and achieve intact landing on solid ground on @/targetBody, transmitting data from its surface.
