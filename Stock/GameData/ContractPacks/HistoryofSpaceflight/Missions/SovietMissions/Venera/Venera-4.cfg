	description = Venera 4, also designated 4V-1 No.310, was similar in design to Venera 3. The probe comprised an entry probe, designed to enter the Venus atmosphere and parachute to the surface, and a carrier/flyby spacecraft, which carried the entry probe to Venus and served as a communications relay for the entry probe. It was the first probe to transmit data from the atmosphere of another planet.&br;&br;The probe was released from the bus and entered the nightside Venusian atmosphere on October 18, 1967. The main bus entered the atmosphere behind the probe but was not designed to survive entry. The probe initially braked using a thick ablative heatshield. At a velocity of 1032 km/hr the 2.2 meter drogue parachute was deployed, followed by a 55 meter main parachute at an altitude of 52 km. The scientific instruments had been turned on 5 minutes after separation at an altitude of about 55 km and remained on for 93 minutes, returning 23 sets of readings, until it reached an altitude of roughly 25 km, where it succumbed to the atmospheric pressure (22 bar) and temperature (277 C). The probe was over the Eisila region at approximately 19 degrees N, 38 degrees E. Although the Venera 4 design did allow for data transmission after landing, the Venera 3â€“6 probes were not built to withstand the pressures at the Venusian surface.
