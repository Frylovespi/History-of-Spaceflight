	description = Venera-2MV-2SA also known as Sputnik 20 in the West, was a Soviet spacecraft, which was launched in 1962 as part of the Venera program, and was intended to become the first spacecraft to land on Venus. Due to a problem with its upper stage it failed to leave low Earth orbit, and reentered the atmosphere a few days later. It was the second of two Venera 2MV-1 spacecraft, both of which failed to leave Earth orbit. The lower stages of the rocket operated nominally, injecting the fourth stage and payload into a low Earth orbit. Following a coast phase, the upper stage was to have ignited around sixty-one minutes and thirty seconds after launch, in order to place the spacecraft into heliocentric orbit. The ignition command did not reach the engine however, and the fuel valves did not open, so the upper stage failed to ignite leaving the payload in geocentric orbit.[5] It reentered the atmosphere on 6 September 1962, five days after it had been launched. Venera-2MV-2SA was launched on a Molniya 8K78 rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on September 1, 1962.
