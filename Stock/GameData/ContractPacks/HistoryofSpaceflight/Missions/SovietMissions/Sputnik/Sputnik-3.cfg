	description = Sputnik 3 was an automatic scientific laboratory spacecraft. The scientific instrumentation (twelve instruments) provided data on pressure and composition of the upper atmosphere, concentration of charged particles, photons in cosmic rays, heavy nuclei in cosmic rays, magnetic and electrostatic fields, and meteoric particles. The outer radiation belts of the Earth were detected during the flight. The spacecraft remained in orbit until April 6, 1960. It was the largest satellite ever flown to that point by far, with a mass that was more than twice as much as the 5 previously flown satellites combined. The objective was to characterize the geophysics and space physics environment from orbit, including the newly discovered radiation belts. It was overseen by the Soviet Academy of Sciences. The probe had a mass of 1327.0 kg.
