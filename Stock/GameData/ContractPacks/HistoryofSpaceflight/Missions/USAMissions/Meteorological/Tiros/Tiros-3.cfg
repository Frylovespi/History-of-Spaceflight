    description = The TIROS Program (Television Infrared Observation Satellite) was NASA's first experimental step to determine if satellites could be useful in the study of the Earth. TIROS 3 was equipped with two independent television camera subsystems for taking cloud cover pictures, plus a two-channel low-resolution radiometer, an omni-directional radiometer, and a five-channel infrared scanning radiometer. TIROS 3 had a mass of 127 kg.&br;&br;TIROS 3 was placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 812 km, a perigee of 742 km, an inclination of 47.9 degrees, and an orbital period of 100.41 minutes. The mission ended with the loss of contact with the spacecraft on February 28, 1962.
