	description = The TIROS Program (Television Infrared Observation Satellite) was NASA's first experimental step to determine if satellites could be useful in the study of the Earth. Tiros-10 was equipped with two 1.27-cm vidicon TV cameras, one medium angle and one wide angle, for taking earth cloudcover pictures. The pictures were transmitted directly to either of two ground receiving stations or were stored in a tape recorder on board for subsequent playback depending on whether the satellite was within or beyond the communication range of the station.&br;&br;TIROS 10 was placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 837 km, a perigee of 751 km, an inclination of 98.7 degrees, and an orbital period of 100.76 minutes. The mission ended with the loss of contact with the spacecraft on July 31, 1966.
