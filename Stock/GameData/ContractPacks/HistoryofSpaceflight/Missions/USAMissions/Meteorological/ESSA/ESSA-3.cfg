	description = ESSA 3 was a 145.0 kg spin-stabilized operational meteorological spacecraft designed to take and record daytime cloud cover pictures on a global basis for subsequent playback to a ground acquisition station. The satellite had essentially the same configuration as that of the TIROS series, i.e., an 18-sided right prism, 107 cm across opposite corners and 56 cm high, with a reinforced baseplate carrying most of the subsystems and a cover assembly (hat). Electrical power was provided by approximately 10,000 1- by 2-cm solar cells that were mounted on the cover assembly and by 21 nickel-cadmium batteries. Two redundant wide-angle cameras were mounted on opposite sides of the spacecraft and canted 75 deg from the spacecraft spin axis. A pair of crossed-dipole command and receiving antennas projected out and down from the baseplate. A monopole telemetry and tracking antenna extended up from the top of the cover assembly.&br;&br;ESSA 3 was placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 1,493 km, a perigee of 1,383 km, an inclination of 100.9 degrees, and an orbital period of 114.6 minutes. The mission ended with the decommissioning of the spacecraft on December 2, 1968.
