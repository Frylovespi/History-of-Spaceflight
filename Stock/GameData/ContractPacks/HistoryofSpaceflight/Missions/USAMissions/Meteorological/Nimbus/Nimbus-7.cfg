	description = The Nimbus satellites were second-generation U.S. robotic spacecraft used for meteorological research and development. The spacecraft were designed to serve as stabilized, Earth-oriented platforms for the testing of advanced systems to sense and collect atmospheric science data. &br;&br;A piggy-back experiment called CAMEO (Chemically Active Material Ejected in Orbit) was included in the Nimbus-G launch. This Goddard Space Flight Center experiment weighted approximately 89 kg and consisted basically of one lithium and four barium gas canisters. These gases were released at orbital altitudes in order to facilitate the study of the boundary structure between the polar cap and the auroral belt, and to evaluate orbital velocity effects on neutral and ion clouds. The CAMEO remained attached to the second stage of the Delta vehicle.
	
    notes = Launch the Nimbus-7 probe and the CAMEO piggyback experiment into a polar orbit and perform meteorological research.
    synopsis = <color=yellow>Nimbus-7 was launched by a Delta-2910 on October 24, 1978 from Vandenberg Air Force Base.</color>
