	description = MIDAS 2 (Missile Defense Alarm System) satellite was an earth-orbiting satellite designed to measure IR background and define IR sources. Along with MIDAS 1 it was part of the MIDAS Series 1 satellites. The Aerojet payload built for the first two low-altitude test demonstration flights consisted of a Bouwers-concentric telescope and 27 lead sulfide detectors. Mounted in a fork beneath the spin table, the telescope elevation could be adjusted on command. The spin table would rotate 360 degrees at 2 rpm about the vertical axis of the satellite in a nose-down attitude. These initial test flights were to be launched into low altitude, near-equatorial orbits from Cape Canaveral, Florida. MIDAS 2 was successfully launched into orbit, but the satellite tumbled as it circled the Earth and, after the first dozen orbits, the Agena communication link failed. The payload could not be operated as planned.
