	description = MIDAS 12, also known as MIDAS-RTS-2 (Research Test Satellite 2), was an extension to the MIDAS program of early warning satellites. It was designed to detect, in real-time, lower-radiance sea-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs), and be capable of determining their launch locations, on two sightings, within a range of 8-to-1O nm, The radiant characteristics of all of the missiles detected around the world also would be identified, measured, and catalogued. MIDAS 12 was launched along with a piggyback satellite into a circular polar orbit. MIDAS 12 operated for 11 months. During this period this spacecraft detected all Soviet and U.S. ballistic missiles launched within it's field of view. Along with MIDAS 11 they identified 139 rocket launched and 4 Soviet launch sites.&br;&br;SECOR 8 (Sequential Collation of Range), also known as EGRS 8 (Electronic & Geodetic Ranging Satellite), was a small geodetic spacecraft used to precisely determine points on the Earth. It was an all-weather geodetic survey system which was in operational use for several years, establishing a global survey network. It used the successive positions of artificial satellites in space to determine locations on the earth's surface with exactness over long distances. SECOR 8 was launched piggyback with MIDAS 12. It had a mass of 17 kg.
