	description = MIDAS 4 was the second of the MIDAS Series 2 missile defense early warning satellites to be launched by the US Air Force. Every 10 seconds the detectors would view approximately 25 million square nautical miles of the Earth's surface, allowing as many as nine possible "looks" at an ICBM between the time it reached 35,000 feet and missile burnout. That number of looks was believed sufficient to identify the direction of missile travel. An Atlas roll-control failure shortly after launch propelled the Agena into an improper ascent trajectory. After separating from the Atlas, the Agena used an abnormal amount of attitude control gas during first and second burns as onboard systems sought to compensate for the trajectory dispersion. Once in orbit, the Agena's attitude continued to fluctuate and all control gas was exhausted by the time it completed its first revolution of the Earth. One of two solar arrays aboard the tumbling Agena failed during the fourth orbit, power depleted, and all electrical equipment was shut down after the 56th orbit.&br;&br;West Ford 1, also known as West Ford Needles, was a piggyback satellite launched along with MIDAS 4. It was an experiment to allow long distance communications by bouncing radio waves off of a band small wires (passive dipoles) cut to a specific length. In an attempt to lay a radio-reflective ring around the world, small metal dipole needles were allowed to sublimate out of a matrix. Two experiments were conducted, one in 1961 and another in 1963. The 1961 experiment was not successful when the needles failed to sufficiently disperse.
