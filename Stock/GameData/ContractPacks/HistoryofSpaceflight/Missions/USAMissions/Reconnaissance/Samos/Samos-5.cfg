    description = SAMOS 5 was a first generation, low resolution photo surveillance spacecraft launched by the US Air Force. Specifically it was a 101B SAMOS film return satellite with a 1.7-meter focal length panoramic camera. This Satellite and Missile Observation Satellite reached orbit but failed to deorbit and return its camera and film capsule and be recovered. The mission was a failure.
