	description = Codenamed Gambit, the KH-7 (Air Force Program 206) was a reconnaissance satellite used by the United States from July 1963 to June 1967. Like the older Corona system, it acquired imagery intelligence by taking photographs and returning the undeveloped film to earth. It achieved a typical ground-resolution of 2 ft to 3 ft. Though most of the imagery from the KH-7 satellites was declassified in 2002, details of the satellite program (and the satellite's construction) remained classified until 2011.&br;&br; Hitchikier 2 (P 11-AS) was an Air Force scientific satellite that carried six experiments. Instrumentation on board included spectrometers and Geiger tubes to measure electrons and protons in various energy ranges (both directional and omni-directional experiments), a Faraday cup, a VLF experiment, and a magnetometer. The spacecraft spin axis was approximately aligned with the earth's spin axis. Telemetry consisted of two tape-recorded and two real-time data channels. Each of two commutators had one real-time and one tape-recorded channel. Two weeks after launch one of the commutators temporarily stopped and thereafter operated intermittently. Four weeks later, the tape-recorded channel on the other commutator failed. On September 1, 1965, the tape recorder failed, and very little scientific data were obtained after that date. It had a mass of 79.0 kg.
