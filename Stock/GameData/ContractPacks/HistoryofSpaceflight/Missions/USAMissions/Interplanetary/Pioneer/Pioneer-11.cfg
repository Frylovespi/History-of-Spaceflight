	description = Pioneer 11 was the second mission to investigate Jupiter and the outer solar system and the first to explore the planet Saturn and its main rings. Pioneer 11, like Pioneer 10, used Jupiter's gravitational field to alter its trajectory radically. It passed close to Saturn and then it followed an escape trajectory from the solar system. During its closest approach, on 3 December 1974, Pioneer 11 passed to within 43,000 km of Jupiter's cloud tops. It passed by Saturn on 1 September 1979, at a distance of 21,000 km from Saturn's cloud tops.
	
	notes = Launch Pioneer 11 on a fly-by trajectory of @targetBody1 and @targetBody2, using the first encounter to sling the spacecraft to the second encounter.
	synopsis = <color=yellow>Pioneer 11 was launched by an Atlas-SLV3D Centaur-D1A Star-37E on April 6, 1973 from the Cape Canaveral Launch Complex.</color>
