	description = Mariner 5 was a refurbished backup spacecraft for the Mariner 4 Mars mission converted to fly a Venus mission. Mariner 5 carried a complement of experiments to probe Venus's atmosphere with radio waves, scan its brightness in ultraviolet light, and sample the solar particles and magnetic field fluctuations above the planet. The project objectives were to pass within 2000 km of Venus to provide data on the structure of the planet's atmosphere and its radiation and magnetic field environment. Mariner 5 was also designed to return data on the interplanetary environment before and after planetary encounter.&br;&br;Mariner 5 was launched on an Atlas Agena D on 14 June 1967. A mid-course correction (a 17.66 second burn) was made on 19 June. Mariner 5 reached Venus on 19 October. Closest approach was at an altitude of 4094 km. Data transmissions occurred after the encounter. Contact was lost on 4 December 1967, but was temporarily regained on 14 October 1968. The spacecraft is now in heliocentric orbit. The mission was a success.
