	description = Mariner 6 and 7 comprised a dual-spacecraft mission to Mars. The primary objectives of the missions were to study the surface and atmosphere of Mars during close flybys to establish the basis for future investigations, particularly those relevant to the search for extraterrestrial life, and to demonstrate and develop technologies required for future Mars missions and other long-duration missions far from the Sun. Mariner 6 and 7 spacecraft were identical, each carried a wide- and narrow-angle television camera, an infrared spectroscope, an infrared radiometer, and an ultraviolet spectroscope.&br;&br;Mariner 6 was launched from Launch Complex 36B at Cape Kennedy on 25 February - Mariner 7 was launched 31 days later. It represented the first mission launched on the Atlas-SLV3C Centaur-D. Mariner 6 encountered Mars on July 31,1969 and was quickly followed by Mariner 7 on August 4, 1969. The two spacecraft returned a combined total of 143 approach pictures of the planet and 55 close-up pictures. The spacecraft also studied the Martian atmosphere and profiled its chemical composition. Closest approach to Mars for both spacecraft was approximately 3,550 kilometers.&br;&br;After departure from Mars into heliocentric orbit, the spacecraft was returned to cruise mode which included engineering and communications tests, star photography TV tests, and UV scans of the Milky Way and an area containing comet 1969-B. Periodic tracking of the spacecraft in its heliocentric orbit was also done.
