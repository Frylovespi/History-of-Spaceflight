	description = Explorer 23, also known as S-55C, was a 133.8 kg micrometeoroid satellite launched by the United States as part of the Explorers Program in 1964. It was the third in the series of S 55 micrometeoroid satellites orbited by NASA. Its purpose was to obtain data on the near-earth meteoroid environment, thus providing an accurate estimate of the probability of penetration in spacecraft structures by meteoroids and allowing a more confident definition of the penetration flux-material thickness relation to be derived. The cylindrical shaped spacecraft, about 61 cm in diameter and 234 cm long, was built around the burned out fourth stage of the Scout launch vehicle, which remained as part of the orbiting satellite. Explorer 23 carried stainless steel pressurized-cell penetration detectors, impact detectors, and cadmium sulphide cell detectors to obtain data on the size, number, distribution, and momentum of dust particles in the near-earth environment.&br;&br;Explorer 23 was placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 865 km, a perigee of 451 km, an inclination of 51.9 degrees, and an orbital period of 97.9 minutes. The mission ended with the loss of contact with the spacecraft on November 7, 1965. It decayed from orbit on June 29, 1983.
