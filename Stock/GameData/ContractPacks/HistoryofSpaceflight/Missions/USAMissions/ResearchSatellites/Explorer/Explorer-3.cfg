	description = Explorer 3 (1958 Gamma 1) was launched in conjunction with the IGY by the U.S. Army (Ordinance) into an eccentric orbit on March 26, 1958 by a Juno I launch vehicle. The objective of this spacecraft was a continuation of experiments started with Explorer 1 with which it was nearly identical. The 14.1 kg spacecraft consisted of a cosmic ray counter (a Geiger-Mueller tube), and a micrometeorite detector (erosion gauge). The Explorer 3 spacecraft was spin stabilized and had an on-board tape recorder to provide a complete radiation history for each orbit.&br;&br;Explorer 3 was placed in a medium Earth orbit with an apogee of 2,799 km, a perigee of 186 km, an inclination of 33.38 degrees, and an orbital period of 115.7 minutes. It was discovered soon after launch that the satellite was in a tumbling motion with a rotational period of about 7 seconds. Explorer 3 decayed from orbit on June 27, 1958, after 93 days of operation.
