	description = Explorer 27, also known as BE-C, Beacon, Explorer-C, and Beacon-C, was a small 60.8 kg ionospheric research satellite instrumented with an electrostatic probe, radio beacons, a passive laser tracking reflector, and a Doppler navigation experiment. Its primary objective was to obtain worldwide observations of total electron content between the spacecraft and the earth. The satellite was initially spin stabilized, but it was de-spun after solar paddle erection. Subsequent stabilization oriented the satellite axis of symmetry with the local magnetic field by means of a strong bar magnet and damping rods. A three-axis magnetometer and sun sensors provided information on the satellite attitude and spin rate. It was the third and last of the Beacons in the Explorers program.&br;&br;Explorer 27 was placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 1,311 km, a perigee of 932 km, an inclination of 41.1 degrees, and an orbital period of 107.6 minutes. The mission ended with the disabling of the spacecraft on July 20, 1973 because its transmission band was going to be used by higher-priority spacecraft.
