However, due to a failure to ignite the fourth stage, the spacecraft did not reach orbit. Explorer 2 fell back to Earth and was destroyed in the atmosphere. Explorer 2 was equipped with a Geiger counter for the purposes of detecting cosmic rays. It was also equipped with a wire grid array and an acoustic detector for the an orbital experiment in micrometeorite detection.
