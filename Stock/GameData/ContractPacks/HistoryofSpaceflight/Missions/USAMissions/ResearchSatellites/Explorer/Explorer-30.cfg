	description = Explorer 30 (NRL SOLRAD 8) was one of the SOLRAD series that began in 1960 to provide continuous coverage of solar radiation with a set of standard photometers. SOLRAD 8 was a 56.7 kg spin-stabilized satellite oriented with its spin axis perpendicular to the sun-satellite line so that the 14 solar X-ray and ultraviolet photometers pointing radially outward from its equatorial belt viewed the sun with each revolution. Data were transmitted in real time by means of an FM/AM telemetry system and were recorded by the stations on the STADAN tracking network.&br;&br;Explorer 30 was placed in a low Earth circular orbit with an apogee of 891 km, a perigee of 704 km, an inclination of 59.7 degrees, and an orbital period of 104 minutes. The mission ended with the loss of data collection due to spin rate loss of the spacecraft in August 1967.
