	description = Explorer 17 was a 183.7 kg spin-stabilized sphere 0.95 m in diameter. The spacecraft was vacuum sealed in order to prevent contamination of the local atmosphere. Explorer 17 carried four pressure gauges for the measurement of total neutral particle density, two mass spectrometers for the measurement of certain neutral particle concentrations, and two electrostatic probes for ion concentration and electron temperature measurements.&br;&br;Explorer 17 was placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 916 km, a perigee of 255 km, an inclination of 57.6 degrees, and an orbital period of 96.39 minutes. The mission ended with the loss of contact of the spacecraft on July 10, 1963. It decayed from orbit on November 25, 1963.
