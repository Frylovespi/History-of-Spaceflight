	description = Explorer 32, also known as Atmosphere Explorer-B (AE-B), was a 224.5 kg upper atmosphere research satellite which was designed to directly measure temperatures, composition, densities, and pressures in the upper atmosphere on a global basis. The satellite was a stainless steel, vacuum-sealed sphere, 0.889 m in diameter. The experimental payload included one ion and two neutral mass spectrometers, three magnetron density gauges, and two electrostatic probes. Additional equipment included optical and magnetic aspect sensors, magnetic attitude and spin rate control systems, and a tape recorder for data acquisition at locations remote from ground receiving stations. Power was supplied by silver-zinc batteries and a solar cell array mounted on the satellite exterior.&br;&br;Explorer 32 was placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 2,725 km, a perigee of 276 km, an inclination of 64.7 degrees, and an orbital period of 116 minutes. The satellite had an operational lifetime of 10 months. The two neutral mass spectrometers failed a few days after launch, but the remaining instruments operated throughout most of the satellite's lifetime. Explorer 32 suffered a depressurization which led to battery failure, at which point it ceased functioning. The mission ended with the deorbiting of the spacecraft on December 22, 1985.
