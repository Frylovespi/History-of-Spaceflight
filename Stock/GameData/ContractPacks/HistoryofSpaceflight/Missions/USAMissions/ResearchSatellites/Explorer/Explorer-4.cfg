	description = Explorer 4 was a United States satellite launched by a Juno I on July 26, 1958. Explorer 4 was identical to the previous three explorers as it was a cylindrical shaped satellite instrumented to make the first detailed measurements of charged particles (protons and electrons) trapped in the terrestrial radiation belts. An unexpected tumble motion of the satellite made the interpretation of the detector data very difficult. The low-power transmitter and the plastic scintillator detector failed September 3, 1958. The two Geiger-Mueller tubes and the cesium iodide crystal detectors continued to operate normally until September 19, 1958. The high-power transmitter ceased sending signals on October 5, 1958. It is believed that exhaustion of the power batteries caused these failures.&br;&br;Explorer 4 was placed in a Medium Earth Orbit with a apogee of 2,213 km, a perigee of 263 km, an inclination of 50.29 degrees, and an orbital period of 110.2 minutes. Last contact with the satellite occurred on October 5, 1958 and it decayed from orbit on October 23, 1959.
