	description = Explorer 33, also known as AIMP-D, IMP-D, AIMP 1, Anchored IMP 1, Interplanetary Monitoring Platform-D, was a 212.0 kg spin-stabilized (spin axis parallel to the ecliptic plane, spin period varying between 2.2 and 3.6 s) spacecraft instrumented for studies of interplanetary plasma, energetic charged particles (electrons, protons, and alphas), magnetic fields, and solar X rays at lunar distances. Originally intended for a lunar orbit, mission controllers worried that the spacecraft's trajectory was too fast to guarantee lunar capture. Consequently, mission managers opted for a backup plan of placing the craft into an eccentric Earth orbit. The mission ended with loss of contact with the spacecraft on September 21, 1971.
