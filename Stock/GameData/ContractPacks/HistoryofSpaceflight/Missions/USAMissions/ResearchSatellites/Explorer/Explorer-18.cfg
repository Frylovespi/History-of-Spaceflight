	description = Explorer 18 (IMP A) was a 138.0 kg solar-cell and chemical-battery powered spacecraft instrumented for interplanetary and distant magnetospheric studies of energetic particles, cosmic rays, magnetic fields, and plasmas. It was manufactured by the Goddard Space Flight Center.&br;&br;Explorer 18 was placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 192,003 km, a perigee of 4,395 km, an inclination of 35.2 degrees, and an orbital period of 5,606 minutes. The mission ended with the loss of contact of the spacecraft on May 10, 1965. It decayed from orbit on December 30, 1965.
