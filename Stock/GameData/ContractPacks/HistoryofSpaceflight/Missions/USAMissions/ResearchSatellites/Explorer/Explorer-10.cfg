	description = Explorer 10 was a 35 kg cylindrical, battery-powered spacecraft instrumented with two fluxgate magnetometers and one rubidium vapour magnetometer extending from the main spacecraft body, and a Faraday cup plasma probe. It was the first satellite to measure the "shock wave" generated by a solar flare. The mission objective was to investigate the magnetic fields and plasma as the spacecraft passed through the earth's magnetosphere and into cislunar space.&br;&br;Explorer 10 was placed in a highly elliptical geocentric orbit with an apogee of 180,999 km, a perigee of 220 km, an inclination of 33 degrees, and an orbital period of 83.50 hours. Last contact with the satellite occurred on March 27, 1961 and it decayed from orbit on June 1, 1968.
