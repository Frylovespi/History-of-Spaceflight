	description = Gemini 12 was the tenth and final flight of the Gemini series, which bridged the Mercury and Apollo programs. This mission, carrying astronauts Jim Lovell and Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin, was scheduled to perform rendezvous and docking with the Agena target vehicle, to conduct three ExtraVehicular Activity (EVA) operations, to conduct a tethered stationkeeping exercise, to perform docked maneuvers using the Agena propulsion system to change orbit, and demonstrate an automatic reentry. There were also 14 scientific, medical, and technological experiments on board. Rendezvous with the Gemini-XII-ATV was completed after three orbits. Docking duration was one day nineteen hours and fourty-five minutes. Gemini-XII was launched on November 11, 1966 from the Cape Canaveral launch site.
