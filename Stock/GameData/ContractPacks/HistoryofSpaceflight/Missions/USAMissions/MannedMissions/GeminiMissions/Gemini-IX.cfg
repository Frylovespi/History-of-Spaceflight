	description = Gemini 9A was the seventh crewed Earth-orbiting spacecraft of the Gemini series. It carried astronauts Tom Stafford and Gene Cernan. Primary mission objectives were to demonstrate rendezvous techniques and docking with a target vehicle to simulate maneuvers to be carried out on future Apollo missions, an ExtraVehicular Activity (EVA) spacewalk to test the Astronaut Maneuvering Unit (AMU), and precision landing capability. Scientific objectives included obtaining zodiacal light and airglow horizon photographs. Two micrometeorite studies were to be carried out, and there were also one medical and two technological experiments. rendezvous was achieved after 3 orbits though docking failed because the ATV failed to deploy its fairing that covered the docking port.

	notes = Launch Gene Cernan and Tom Stafford in the Gemini IX spacecraft into orbit, rendezvous with Gemini IX ATDA, and return home.
