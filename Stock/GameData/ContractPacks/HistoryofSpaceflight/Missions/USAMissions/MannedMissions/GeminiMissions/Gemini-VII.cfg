	description = Gemini VII was the fourth crewed Earth-orbiting spacecraft of the Gemini series, having been launched before Gemini VI-A. It carried astronauts Frank Borman and Jim Lovell on the 14 day mission. Its mission priorities were to demonstrate a 2-week flight, to perform station keeping with the Gemini launch vehicle stage 2, to evaluate the 'shirt sleeve' environment and the lightweight pressure suit, to act as a passive rendezvous target for Gemini VI, and to demonstrate controlled reentry close to the target landing point. The crew members had three scientific, four technological, four spacecraft, and eight medical experiments to perform.&br;&br;Gemini VI-A was launched on December 15, after a three-day-long delay due to a malfunction and engine shutdown immediately after ignition. It entered into an 87-by-140-nautical-mile (161 by 259 km) orbit, and was briefly visible from Gemini VII just after launch. Borman and Lovell were also able to see the contrail from the launch.

	notes = Launch the Gemini VII capsule into orbit, await rendezvous with Gemini VI-A and return home after thirteen days and three hours in orbit.
