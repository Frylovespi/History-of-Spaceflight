	description = LES-2 (Lincoln Experimental Satellite 2) was a 31.0 kg US military communications satellite. It was identical to the already launched LES 1. It contained solid-state X-band radio equipment, low-power logic circuits, electronic de-spinning (using optics to determine the location of the Earth and Sun relative to a spinning satellite at any moment, and then transmitting via whichever of several antennae were best positioned with respect to the Earth), and magnetic torquers.&br;&br;This was also the fourth Titan IIIA flight test missile (Vehicle #6), launched from Complex 20 at Cape Canaveral in a maneuverability test for the Transtage. The primary aim was for the Transtage engine to accomplish four separate ignitions, something never before attempted. In the process of successfully completing its four programmed ignitions and burns, the Transtage placed two satellites into orbit - a Lincoln Experimental Satellite (LES-2) and a hollow aluminum radar calibration sphere (LCS-1). By completing its assigned tasks, the Transtage extended the capabilities of the Titan IIIA beyond it's specific requirements.&br;&br; LCS-1 was placed into a circular orbit at roughly 2,800 km altitude, while LES 2 was placed in an elliptical medium Earth orbit with an apogee of 14,810 km, a perigee of 2,771 km, an inclination of 32.2 degrees.
