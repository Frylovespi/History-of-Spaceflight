	description = SECOR 5 was a small geodetic satellite used to precisely determine points on the earth. It was launched from the WSMC as a joint venture of the US Army and Navy to locate Pacific islands. Experiments with these led to Timation, and finally to the GPS Navstar system. It had a mass of 18.0 kg and was launched from a Scout rocket from the Wallops Island launch site on August 10, 1965.
