	description = Transit O-3 was a US Navy navigation satellite. Transit, one of the first operational satellite systems, was also known as the Navy Navigation Satellite (NNS).&br;&br;SECOR 2 was a small geodetic satellite used to precisely determine points on the earth. It was launched from the WSMC as a joint venture of the US Army and Navy to locate Pacific islands. Experiments with these led to Timation, and finally to the GPS Navstar system. It had a mass of 18.0 kg. The SECOR 2 satellite failed to deploy from the Ablestar's piggyback container and was never activated in orbit.

	notes = Launch the Transit-O3 navigational satellite into orbit but fail to deploy the SECOR satellite from its piggyback container.
	synopsis = Transit O-3 and SECOR 2 were launched by a Thor Ablestar on March 11, 1965 from the Vandenberg AFB Launch Complex.
