         description = The MIDAS 7 (MIssile Defense Alarm System) satellite was designed primarily to detect the exhaust heat from a recently launched ICBM by use of infrared sensors. A secondary objective was to eject 350 million copper needles into earth orbit (Project West Ford). The needles were to serve as an artificial scattering medium for radio signals in the centimeter band. The spacecraft was cylindrically shaped measuring approximately 6 m in length and 1.5 m in diameter. Once in orbit, the spacecraft was stabilized in a nose-down attitude so that the IR sensors and telemetry antenna were always facing earthward. This US Air Force early warning spacecraft was launched along with TRS 4 and Dash 2. The rocket did not eject the ERS 10 subsatellite. It was launched from an Atlas-Agena B rocket from the Point Arguello launch site on July 18, 1963.
