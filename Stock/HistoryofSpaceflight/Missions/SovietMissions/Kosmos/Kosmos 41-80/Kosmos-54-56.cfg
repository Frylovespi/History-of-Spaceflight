         description = Kosmos 54, 55, and 56 were Stella 1 type communications satellites. These satellites operate as mailboxes ("store-and-forward"): they remember the received messages and then resend them after scheduled time, or by command from the Earth. All 3 were released in orbit at the same time and it was hoped that natural drift would keep them apart. Each satellite had a mass of 50.0 kg and were launched by the Soviet Union store-and-forward"): they remember the received messages and then resend them after scheduled time, or by command from the Earth. They were launched by the Soviet Union on February 21, 1965. They were launched on a Kosmos-1 65S3 rocket from the Tyuratam Launch Complex at the Baikonur Cosmodrome.
