         description = American short range liquid-propellant ballistic missile. The first American operational guided missile, deployed 1954-1964. Replaced by the Sergeant solid-propellant missile. Development began under Project ORDCIT with a series of research rockets begun in 1944 (Private, WAC Corporal, Corporal E). Continued delays in the costly Hermes program led to a 1950 decision to cancel it and instead develop the Corporal into a tactical nuclear-armed ballistic missile. The MGM-5-Corporal had a thrust of 89.20 kN, a height of 14.02 m, a diameter of 0.76 m, and a payload 680 kg. It was first launched on December 6, 1951 from the White Sands Missile Range.
