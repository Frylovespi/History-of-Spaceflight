How to install History of Spaceflight:

0. Be sure to have the latest version of Contract Configurator installed.
1. Unzip contract packs to a new folder.
2. Choose which version you want to play based on your install: either RSS/RP-0 mod or Stock.
3. Copy the GameData folder of your chosen version into your main KSP directory.
4. When updating to a new version it's best to delete the previously installed HistoryofSpaceflight as well as ModuleManager.ConfigCache, and ModuleManager.ConfigSHA from your GameData folder to make sure it loads the new contracts that were added.

OPTIONAL 1: Soviet, US and international missions are fully separate. 
You can safely remove any of these submaps (from Gamedata\ContractPacks\HistoryofSpaceflight\Missions) if you do not wish to use them.

OPTIONAL 2: In addition to nations, certain programs within nation packs can also be safely removed - though certainly not all! 
Examples which can be safely removed are the lengthy recon programs of both the US (KH1-KH8) and Soviets (Kosmos). 
An easy way to check if a program/contract you want removed has dependencies: 
Remove the contracts, load the game and check in the contract configurator debug menu (Alt+F10) if any remaining contracts show up in red text. 
If so, you just removed a dependency. 
You can then either reinstate the removed contracts, or remove the dependency from within the contract(s) that gave the error - this can be done inside the specified contract cfg file.
