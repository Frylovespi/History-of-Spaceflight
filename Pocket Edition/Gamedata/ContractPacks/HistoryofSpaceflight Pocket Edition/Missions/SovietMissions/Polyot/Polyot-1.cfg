	description = Polyot 1 was the first of two spacecraft fitted with special controls to allow for maneuvrability in space, as a mission to test the propulsion of the new I2P coorbital ASAT satellite. The spacecraft was able to change inclination as well as apogee and perigee. It also carried scientific instruments, a telemetry system, and radio transmitters. Flight was considered a great success. Micro-engine fired 350 times and main stabilizing engine fired 300 times. Polyot was equipped with 6 x 400 kgf engines and 16 x 1 kgf verniers. It consisted of a cylindrical guidance section, the engine section with spherical propellant tanks, and the forward warhead section. It had a mass of 600.0 kg.
