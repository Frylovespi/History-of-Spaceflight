	description = The R-5 was the first Soviet missile to be armed with a nuclear warhead, the first for which the new southern facility at Dnepropetrovsk took over full design and production responsibility. It was also the end of the road in being the ultimate extrapolation of German V-2 technology. Later missiles of both Yangel and Korolev would use other propellants and engine designs. The R-5 could deliver a 1425 kg warhead over a range of 1200 km, doubling the performance of the R-2. After reaching a velocity of 3044 m/s at burnout, the missile arced up to a maximum altitude of 300 km during a 10.5 minute glide before impacting in the target area with an accuracy of 6 km in range, 5 km laterally. It could be configured to also drop up to four smaller bombs.&br;&br;The R-5 had a mass of 28,625 kg, a height of 21.34 m, a diameter of 1.65 m, a payload 1425 kg, a max altitude of 300 km, and a range of 1100 km.
