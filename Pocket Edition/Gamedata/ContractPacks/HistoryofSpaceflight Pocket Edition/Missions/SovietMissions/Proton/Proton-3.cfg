	description = Proton 3 was the third in a series of spacecraft from which cylindrical payloads containing instruments for studying cosmic rays of energies up to 10 to the 13 eV were launched. Proton 3 also studied the nuclear interaction of particles in the range of 10 to the 12 eV. This payload decayed after 72 days in orbit.

	notes = Launch Proton 3 particle physics research satellite into a low orbit.
	synopsis = <color=yellow>Proton 3 was launched by a Proton rocket on July 6, 1966 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome.</color>
