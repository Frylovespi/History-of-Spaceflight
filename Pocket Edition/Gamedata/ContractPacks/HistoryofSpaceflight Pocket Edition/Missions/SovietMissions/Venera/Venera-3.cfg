	description = Venera 3 (meaning Venus 3) was a Venera program space probe that was built and launched by the Soviet Union to explore the surface of Venus. During 1965, the Central Committee, frustrated at the poor track record of Sergei Korolev's OKB-1 design bureau, reassigned the planetary probe program to the Lavochkin Bureau. In over two dozen attempts dating back to 1958, Luna 2 and Luna 3 were the only probes to complete all of their mission objectives. The probe impacted Venus on March 1, 1966, making Venera 3 the first spacecraft to impact on the surface of another planet. However, the communications systems had failed on 16 February, before planetary data could be returned.&br;&br;Although communications had failed, estimates of the impact site put it in an area between 20 N and 30 S latitude, and 60 to 80 E longitude, with impact at approximately 06:56 UT.
