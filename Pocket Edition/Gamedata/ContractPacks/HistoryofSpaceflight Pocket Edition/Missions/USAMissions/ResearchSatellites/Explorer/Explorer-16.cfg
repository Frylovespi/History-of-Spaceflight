	description = Explorer 16 was the second in the series of micrometeorite satellites orbited by NASA. Its purpose was to obtain data on the near-earth meteoroid environment, thus providing an accurate estimate of the probability of penetration in spacecraft structures by meteoroids and allowing a more confident definition of the relationship between penetration flux and material thickness to be derived. It had a mass of 100.8 kg.&br;&br;Explorer 16 was placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 1,181 km, a perigee of 750 km, an inclination of 52 degrees, and an orbital period of 104.3 minutes. The mission ended with a loss of contact in July of 1963.
