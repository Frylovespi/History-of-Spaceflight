	description = Explorer 29, also known as GEOS 1 and GEOS A, was a 387.0 kg gravity-gradient-stabilized, solar-cell powered unit designed exclusively for geodetic studies. It was the first successful active spacecraft of the National Geodetic Satellite Program. Instrumentation included: four optical beacons, laser reflectors, a radio range transponder, Doppler beacons, and a range and range rate transponder. These were designed to operate simultaneously to fulfill the objectives of locating observation points (geodetic control stations) in a three dimensional earth center-of-mass coordinate system within 10 m of accuracy, of defining the structure of the earth's irregular gravitational field and refining the locations and magnitudes of the large gravity anomalies, and of comparing results of the various systems onboard the spacecraft to determine the most accurate and reliable system.&br;&br;Explorer 29 was placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 2,275 km, a perigee of 1,113 km, an inclination of 59.4 degrees, and an orbital period of 120.3 minutes. The mission ended with a command system failure of the spacecraft on December 21, 1966.
