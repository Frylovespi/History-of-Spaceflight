	description = Explorer 14 was a 40 kg spin-stabilized, solar-cell-powered spacecraft instrumented to measure cosmic-ray particles, trapped particles, solar wind protons, and magneto-spheric and interplanetary magnetic fields. It was the second of the S 3 series of spacecraft, which also included Explorers 12.&br;&br;Explorer 14 was placed in a highly elliptical geocentric orbit with an apogee of 96,189 km, a perigee of 2,601 km, an inclination of 42.8 degrees, and an orbital period of 2184.6 minutes. Last contact occurred on August 11, 1963 and it decayed from orbit on May 25, 1988.
