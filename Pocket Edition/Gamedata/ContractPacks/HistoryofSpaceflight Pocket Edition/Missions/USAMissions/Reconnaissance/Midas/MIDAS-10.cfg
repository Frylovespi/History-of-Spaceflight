	description = MIDAS 10, also known as MIDAS-RTS-1 (Research Test Satellite 1), was an extension to the MIDAS program of early warning satellites. It was designed to detect, in real-time, lower-radiance sea-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs), and be capable of determining their launch locations, on two sightings, within a range of 8-to-1O nm, The radiant characteristics of all of the missiles detected around the world also would be identified, measured, and catalogued. The MIDAS 10 satellite was launched from Vandenberg AFB on 9 June 1966. The  Agena rocket engine failed to ignite for its second burn and, instead of a 2000 nm circular polar orbit, the satellite remained in a highly elliptical parking orbit. Worse, the Agena tumbled and its attitude control gas quickly exhausted. No useful tests of the infrared payload could be performed, and a few months later, on 3 December 1966, the satellite dipped into the Earth's lower atmosphere over Australia and incinerated. Onboard this flight were the US Air Force piggyback satellites SECOR 6 and ERS 16 that were to be deployed upon orbital insertion. The piggyback satellites were successfully deployed before the Agena lost attitude control.&br;&br;SECOR 6 (Sequential Collation of Range), also known as EGRS 6 (Electronic & Geodetic Ranging Satellite), was a small geodetic spacecraft used to precisely determine points on the Earth. It was an all-weather geodetic survey system which was in operational use for several years, establishing a global survey network. It used the successive positions of artificial satellites in space to determine locations on the earth's surface with exactness over long distances. SECOR 6 was launched piggyback with MIDAS 10 and ERS 16 and was successfully deployed before the Agena lost attitude control. It had a mass of 17 kg.&br;&br;ERS 16 (ORS 2), was a continuation of the Environmental Research Satellites Program by the United States Air Force Office of Aerospace Research. The basic configuration of the ORS Mk.2 spacecrafts was a regular octahedron measuring 23 cm on a side. Solar cells mounted on each side of the faces provide sufficient electrical power to operate the experiments and the telemetry system when the satellite is illuminated by the sun. No internal battery or control system were provided. The satellite subsystems consisted of electrical power, antenna, telemetry, experiments, and mechanical structure. ERS 16 carried a cold welding experiment consisting of five metal to metal tests using actuators. It had a mass of 5 kg.
