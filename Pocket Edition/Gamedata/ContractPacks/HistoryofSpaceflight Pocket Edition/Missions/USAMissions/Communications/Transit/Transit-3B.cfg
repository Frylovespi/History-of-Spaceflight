    description = The Navy Transit 3B contained a navigation payload experiment. It demonstrated the feasibility of using satellites as navigational aids. Transit spacecraft were developed for updating the inertial navigation systems on board US Navy Polaris submarines, and later for civilian use. The receivers used the known characteristics of the satellites orbit, measured the Doppler shift of the satellites radio signal, and thereby calculated the receivers position on the earth.&br;&br;Also hitchhiking on this launch was the LOFTI 1 satellite. The two satellites failed to separate from the Able-Star stage and from each other owing to a programmer malfunction during launch. The orbit was more elliptical than the planned circular orbit, which shortened the satellite's lifetime to 37 days. Satellite transmitters functioned normally, and signals were received although the elliptical orbit decreased the value of the data. They had a combined mass of 600 kg.
