	description = The Apollo-Saturn 203 (AS-203) mission was an unmanned suborbital flight to test the Saturn 1B launch vehicle and the Apollo Command and Service Modules. The objectives of the flight were to verify the structural integrity, launch loads, stage separation, and operation of subsystems of the Saturn 1B, and evaluate the Apollo spacecraft separations, emergency detection system, subsystems, heatshield at high re-entry velocity, and mission support facilities. It successfully achieved its objectives, but the stage was inadvertently destroyed after four orbits. It was launched on July 5, 1966 from the Cape Canaveral launch site.
