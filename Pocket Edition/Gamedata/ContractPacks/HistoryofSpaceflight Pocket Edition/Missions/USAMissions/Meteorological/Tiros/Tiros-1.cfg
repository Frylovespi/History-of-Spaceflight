	description = The TIROS Program (Television Infrared Observation Satellite) was NASA's first experimental step to determine if satellites could be useful in the study of the Earth. At that time, the effectiveness of satellite observations was still unproven. Since satellites were a new technology, the TIROS Program also tested various design issues for spacecraft: instruments, data and operational parameters. The goal was to improve satellite applications for Earth-bound decisions, such as "should we evacuate the coast because of the hurricane?".&br;&br;TIROS 1 was placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 750 km, a perigee of 693 km, an inclination of 48.4 degrees, and an orbital period of 99.16 minutes. The mission ended with the loss of contact with the spacecraft on June 15, 1960.
