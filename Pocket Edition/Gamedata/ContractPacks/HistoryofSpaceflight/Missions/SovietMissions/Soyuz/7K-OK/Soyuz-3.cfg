	description = Soyuz 3 ("Union 3") was a spaceflight mission launched by the Soviet Union on 26 October 1968. Flown by Georgy Beregovoy, the Soyuz 7K-OK spacecraft completed 81 orbits over four days. The 47-year old Beregovoy was a decorated WWII flying ace and the oldest person to go into space up to that time. Soyuz 3 went into a co-orbit with Soyuz 2, performed a radio search for it, and accomplished an automatic approach to it until they were 200 m apart. Repeated manual approaches toward Soyuz 2 were made, reducing the difference in velocity between the two afts to less than 1 mph. However, actual docking was not accomplished. Television coverage of the operations was provided by external cameras.
