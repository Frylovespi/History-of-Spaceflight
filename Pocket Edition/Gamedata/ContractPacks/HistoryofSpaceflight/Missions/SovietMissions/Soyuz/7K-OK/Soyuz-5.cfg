	description = Soyuz 5 (Russian: Union 5) was a Soyuz mission using the Soyuz 7K-OK spacecraft launched by the Soviet Union on 15 January 1969, which docked with Soyuz 4 in orbit. Soyuz 5 was launched with a crew of three men -- Boris Volynov, Commander, Aleksey Yeliseyev, Flight Engineer, and Yevgeniy Khrunov, Research Engineer. It was the first-ever docking of two manned spacecraft of any nation, and the first-ever transfer of crew from one space vehicle to another of any nation, the only time a transfer was accomplished with a space walk – two months before the US Apollo 9 mission performed the first ever internal crew transfer. The flight was also memorable for its dramatic re-entry. The craft's service module did not separate, so it entered the atmosphere nose-first, leaving cosmonaut Boris Volynov hanging by his restraining straps. As the craft aerobraked, the atmosphere burned through the module. But the craft righted itself before the escape hatch was burned through. Then, the parachute lines tangled and the landing rockets failed, resulting in a hard landing which broke Volynov's teeth.
	
    notes = Launch Soyuz 5 to a successful docking with Soyuz 4. Transfer 2 crewmembers to Soyuz 4 via EVA. Safely return the remaining pilot.
