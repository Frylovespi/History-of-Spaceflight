    description = Soyuz 2 (Russian: Union 2) was an uncrewed spacecraft in the Soyuz family intended to be the target of a docking maneuver by the manned Soyuz 3 spacecraft and as such was equipped with a passive docking port. It was intended to be the first docking of a manned spacecraft in the Soviet space program. It flew in the typical low parking orbit of the Cosmos precursor flights and subsequently, on October 23 or 27, served as a target vehicle for the radio search and attempted docking of the manned Soyuz 3. Although the two craft approached closely, the docking did not take place and the first successful Soviet docking of manned spacecraft took place in the joint Soyuz 4 and Soyuz 5 mission. It made a soft landing after the mission and was recovered on October 28.
	
    notes = Launch the Soyuz-2 into a parking orbit, to prepare for docking with the Soyuz-3. Return the capsule afterwards.
    synopsis = <color=yellow>Soyuz 2 was launched by a Soyuz 11A511 rocket on October 25, 1968 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome.</color>
