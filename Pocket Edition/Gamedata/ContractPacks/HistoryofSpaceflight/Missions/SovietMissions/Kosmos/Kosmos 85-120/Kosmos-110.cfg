	description = Kosmos-110 was the final launch of the Voskhod rocket. It carried two dogs, Veterok and Ugolyok. It incorporated a re-entry body (capsule) for landing scientific instruments and test objects. It was a biological satellite that made a sustained biomedical experiment through the Van Allen radiation belts with the dogs Veterok and Ugolyok. On March 16, after 22 days in orbit around the Earth, they were safely landed. 
	
	notes = Launch the Kosmos-110 probe into orbit and recover the capsule.
