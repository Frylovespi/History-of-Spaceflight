	description = Kosmos 26, also known as DS-MG 1, was a technology demonstration and magnetospheric research satellite launched by the Soviet Union on March 18, 1964. It was launched on a Kosmos-2l 63S1 from Pad 2 of the Mayak Launch Complex. It had a mass of 365 kg and was part of the Dnepropetrovsk Sputnik program. Its primary mission was to demonstrate an electric gyrodyne orientation system. It also carried a magnetospheric research package as a secondary payload.&br;&br;Kosmos 26 was placed in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of 387 km, a perigee of 266 km, an inclination of 49 degrees, and an orbital period of 91 minutes. It decayed from orbit on September 28, 1964.
