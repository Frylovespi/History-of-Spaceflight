	description = Kosmos 42 and Kosmos 43 were Stella 1 type communications satellites. These satellites operate as mailboxes ("store-and-forward"): they remember the received messages and then resend them after scheduled time, or by command from the Earth. Both were released in orbit at the same time and it was hoped that natural drift would keep them apart. Each satellite had a mass of 50.0 kg and were launched by the Soviet Union store-and-forward"): they remember the received messages and then resend them after scheduled time, or by command from the Earth. 

	synopsis = <color=yellow>Kosmos 42 and Kosmos 43 were launched by a Kosmos-1 65S3 on December 19, 1964 from the Mayak Launch Complex at Kapustin Yar.</color>
