	description = Kosmos 125 was a Soviet Radar Ocean Reconnaissance Satellite (RORSAT) prototype launched from the Baikonur cosmodrome aboard a Soyuz launch vehicle. RORSATs were launched to search the oceans for US Navy task forces and other shipping. It was launched on a Soyuz rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on July 20, 1966. Kosmos-125 was lost on the 52nd revolution as a result of a possible failure in the chemical power units placed on board instead of the nuclear BES-5.
