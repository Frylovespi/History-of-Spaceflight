	description = Voskhod 3KV-1 (Kosmos 47) was the first unmanned test of the Voskhod 11A57 Spacecraft. The vehicle had a mass of 5,320-kg and was a test of the three person version of the Voskhod spacecraft. Voskhod 3KV-1 was successfully recovered on 7 October, after a flight of 1 day and 16 minutes. Officially, Kosmos 47 was launched for the “investigation of the upper atmosphere and outer space” (as all other Kosmos satellites). 

	notes = Launch the Voskhod 3KV-1 spacecraft into space and return safely.
