Luna 11 was launched towards the Moon from an earth-orbiting platform and entered lunar orbit on 27 August 1966. The objectives of the mission included the study of: lunar gamma and X-ray emissions in order to determine the Moon's chemical composition; lunar gravitational anomalies; the concentration of meteorite streams near the Moon; the intensity of hard corpuscular radiation near the Moon. It had a mass of 245.0 kg.
