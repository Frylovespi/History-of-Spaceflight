	description = Vostok 5, the fifth spacecraft in the USSRs manned flight series, was piloted by cosmonaut Valeriy F. Bykovskiy. The spacecraft consisted of a nearly spherical cabin covered with ablative material. There were three small portholes and external radio antennas. Radios, a life support system, instrumentation, and an ejection seat were contained in the manned cabin. This cabin was attached to a service module that carried chemical batteries, orientation rockets, the main retro system, and added support equipment for the total system, This module was separated from the manned cabin on reentry. This flight launched at 14:58:58 Moscow Time (11:58:58 UT) on June 14, 1963, and lasted for 5 days setting a Soviet crewed duration record of 119 hr 6 min. Vostok 5 completed 81 orbits before landing northwest of Karaganda on June 19, 1963. During this flight Vostok 5 flew with Vostok 6 for 3 days maintaining two-way radio communications and establishing communications with earth at regular intervals. TV pictures of the cosmonauts in their cabins were relayed to earth, and a series of biomedical and scientific experiments were conducted.
