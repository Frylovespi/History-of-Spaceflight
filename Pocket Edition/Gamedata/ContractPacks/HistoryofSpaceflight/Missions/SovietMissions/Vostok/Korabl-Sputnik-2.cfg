	description = Korabl-Sputnik 2  was the second (official) Vostok launch in a series of spacecraft designed to further the development of an Earth orbiting system for the planned manned space program. The spacecraft carried two dogs, Strelka and Belka, in addition to a television system and other scientific instrumentation. After a one day flight, the spacecraft and both dogs were successfully recovered.        

	notes = Launch the Korabl-Sputnik 2 capsule with canine passengers into orbit and return safely.
