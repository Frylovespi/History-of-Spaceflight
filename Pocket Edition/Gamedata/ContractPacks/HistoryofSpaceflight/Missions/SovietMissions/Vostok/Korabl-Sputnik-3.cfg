    description = Korabl-Sputnik 3 carried two dogs, Pchelka and Mushka, as well as a television system and other scientific instruments. After about twenty-four hours in orbit, on the seventeenth orbit, the main TDU-1 engine was to fire to initiate reentry. Unfortunately, there was a malfunction in the stabilization system of the engine; the resulting firing was far shorter than had been planned.\n\nAlthough the spacecraft would still reenter, computations showed that the landing would overshoot Soviet territory. At this point, a special and unusual system was called into operation, one that was installed to address this precise situation: given the extreme secrecy and xenophobia of the missile and space programs, the only option for designers was to install a self-destruct system aboard the vehicle to destroy the "evidence" before recovery by non-Soviet parties. The system went into operation at the beginning of reentry and destroyed the spacecraft along with its hapless passengers. At the time, the Soviet press merely announced that because of the incorrect attitude, the descent apparatus had burned up on reentry.
  
	notes = Launch the Korabl-Sputnik 3 capsule with canine passengers into orbit and destroy the capsule on re-entry to prevent the enemy from learning our secrets.
