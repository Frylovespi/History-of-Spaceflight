        description = The R-1 rocket (NATO reporting name SS-1 Scunner, Soviet code name SA11, GRAU index 8A11) was a Tactical ballistic missile manufactured in the Soviet Union based on the German V-2 rocket. Even though it was a copy, it was manufactured using Soviet industrial plants and gave the Soviets valuable experience which later enabled the USSR to construct its own much more capable rockets. In 1945 the Soviets captured several key V-2 rocket production facilities, and also gained the services of some German scientists and engineers related to the project. In particular the Soviets gained control of the main V-2 manufacturing facility at Nordhausen, and had 30 V-2 missiles assembled there by September 1946.&br;&br;Despite the threatening supervision of the program by Stalin's secret police chief, Beria, and the assistance of German rocket engineers, it took eight years for the German technology to be absorbed and the missile to be put into service. It was almost immediately superseded by later designs, but the effort laid the groundwork for the Soviet rocket industry. Surplus R-1's were converted to use as sounding rockets for military and scientific research missions.&br;&br;The Soviet versions also used their in home produced engine the RD-100 and gained valuable insights for their almost identical R-2 missiles which were being developed concurrently.&br;&br;The R-1B could carry a 800 kg payload to a maximum range of 270 km. &br;&br; Payload: 800 kg&br; Gross mass: 13,430 kg&br; Thrust: 304.00 kN&br; Height: 14.02 m&br; Diameter: 1.65 m&br; Span: 3.56 m&br; Max Apogee: 110 km&br; Max Velocity: 1,350 m/s.
