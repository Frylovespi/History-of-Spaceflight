	description = Designed in 1959 and first tested in 1961, the R-9A was a great improvement over previous Soviet missile designs. The missile was not only very accurate, but was also far more tactically useful to the Soviet Union. Previous Soviet designs, fueled with cryogenic LOX and kerosene, commonly took hours to fuel and launch. The R-9A, on the other hand, could be launched 20 minutes from the time a launch order was given. NPO "Electropribor" (Kharkiv, Ukraine) designed the missile's control system. Though the last Soviet missile to use cryogenic propellant, this design is one of the most widely deployed ICBMs to use cryogenic fuel.&br;&br;OKB-456 (later renamed to NPO Energomash) developed the initial stage of the two-stage missile, a four-chambered closed cycle design. The second stage, connected by trusses to the first stage (much like the modern Soyuz rocket) was also four-chambered, but utilized open combustion chambers more suited to very high altitudes. This rocket engine was a product of the OKB-154 design team. Guidance of the warhead, like most ICBMs before and after it, was totally inertial save the final ten seconds before detonation of the warhead, which was controlled by a radio-altimeter correction system. The R-9A was capable of delivering a 1600 kg payload  to a maximum combat range of 11,000 km. It was designed to achieve an accuracy of 2 km.
