	description = Proton 2 was the second in a series of four spacecraft from which a cylindrical payload containing an instrument compartment and extended solar panels was launched. The instruments were capable of studying cosmic rays in the range up to 10 to the 13 eV. It also served as a test for the Proton rocket.

	notes = Launch Proton 2 particle physics research satellite into a low orbit.
