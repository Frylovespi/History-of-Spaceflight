	description = Project Paperclip at the end of the of World War II was a great success for the United States. They captured 127 German Rocket Technicians, amongst them Wernher Von Braun, and a treasure trove of rocket parts and designs. Between 1945 and 1952 67 V-2's were assembled for various tests, including some of the first tests with animals. The first animals sent into space were fruit flies aboard a U.S. launched V-2 rocket named Blossom-1 on 20 February 1947 from White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico. The purpose of the experiment was to explore the effects of radiation exposure at high altitudes. The rocket reached 68 miles (109 km) in 3 minutes and 10 seconds, past both the U.S. Air Force 50-mile and the international 100 km definitions of the boundary of space. The 'Blossom' capsule was ejected and successfully deployed its parachute. The fruit flies were recovered alive.
