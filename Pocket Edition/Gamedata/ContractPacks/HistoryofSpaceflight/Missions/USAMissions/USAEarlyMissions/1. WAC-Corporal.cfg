	description = In 1944, the Army Ordnance Department began funding a rocket development program by the California Institute of Technology. The planned sounding rocket was called WAC Corporal and could lift 11 kg of instruments to an altitude of at least 30 km. It was a two stage sounding rocket. The first stage was a booster stage Tiny Tim 1 Ft solid fueled booster. The second sustainer stage was powered by a small liquid fueled engine. The first flight occurred in September 1945 and the rocket reached an altitude of 70 km but the nose cone recovery system failed. The success of the WAC Corporal led to the SSM-A-17/MGM-5 which is the first operation guided missile of the U.S Army.
