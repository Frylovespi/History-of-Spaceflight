	description = The Starfish radiation spacecraft was launched by the US Air Force from Vandenberg AFB on a Thor Agena-D rocket. It was a research satellite whose purpose was to study the artificial radiation belts created by the Starfish-Prime nuclear test. The satellite consisted of instruments mounted on the Agena-D upper stage. They were not to be separated from the Agena-D. Star-Rad 1 was successfully launched from Vandenberg into an highly elliptical orbit, which allowed for repeated passes through the Starfish radiation belt. Results of the mission were not revealed. STARAD was procured via the Corona program reconnaissance satellite program and received therefore the designation Corona 54.
