    description = SAMOS 2 was launched from the Pacific Missile Range into a near-circular polar orbit to determine the capability for making observations of space, the atmosphere, and the nature of the globe from satellites. The 4100-lb spacecraft was a cylinder 22 ft long and 5 ft in diameter, and it comprised the entire Agena A second stage. Included in the instrumentation were photographic and associated test equipment, acoustical micrometeorite detection apparatus, a plasma probe, and an electric field meter. The computer on board was digital-to-analog. Telemetry, tracking, and command equipment completed the payload.SAMOS 2 had a mass of 1900.0 kg (excluding Agena).
