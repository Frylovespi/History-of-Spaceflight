	description = SAMOS 10  was launched from Vandenberg AFB on an Atlas Agena B rocket. It was a second generation, photo surveillance mission of the Satellite and Missile Observation Satellite (SAMOS) system and was the 11th and last launch in the series. It produced poor results. It had a mass of 1860.0 kg. Also launched piggyback on this flight was the Environmental Research Satellite 1 (ERS 1).&br;&br;ERS 1 was part of a research conducted by the US Air Force. The satellites were built by TRW Systems Group for the United States Air Force Office of Aerospace Research (AFOAR). Depending on the shape, these satellites are also referred to as the Tetrahedral Research Satellite (TRS) or Octahedral Research Satellite (ORS). The basic configuration of the TRS Mk.1 spacecrafts was a regular octahedron measuring 16 cm on a side. Solar cells mounted on each side of the faces provide sufficient electrical power to operate the experiments and the telemetry system when the satellite is illuminated by the sun. No internal battery or command system were provided. The satellite subsystems consisted of electrical power, antenna, telemetry, experiments, and mechanical structure.
