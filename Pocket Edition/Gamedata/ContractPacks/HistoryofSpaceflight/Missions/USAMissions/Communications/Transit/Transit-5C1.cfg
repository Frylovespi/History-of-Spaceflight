	description = Transit 5C1, also known as Transit 9, was a US Navy navigation satellite also known as the Navy Navigation Satellite (NNS). Transit 5C-1 was similar to the Transit 5A series series but involved some redesign to improve performance. This satellite was launched on 3 June 1964 and operated successfully until 23 August 1965.
