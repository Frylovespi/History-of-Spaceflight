	description = The next series of Transit satellites were operational prototype satellites. After the launches of the experimental Transit satellites, the Scout-X3 rocket was selected as the dedicated launch vehicle for the program because it delivered a payload into orbit for the lowest cost per pound. However, the Scout-X3 decision imposed two design constraints. First, the weights of the earlier satellites were about 135 kg each, but the Scout launch capacity to the Transit orbit was about 55 kg (it was later increased significantly). A satellite mass reduction had to be achieved despite a demand for more power than APL had previously designed into a satellite. The second problem concerned the increased vibration that affected the payload during launching because the Scout used solid rocket motors. Thus, electronic equipment that was smaller than before and rugged enough to withstand the increased vibration of launch had to be produced. The satellite verified a new technique for deploying the solar panels and for separating from the rocket, but otherwise it was not successful because of trouble with the power system.
