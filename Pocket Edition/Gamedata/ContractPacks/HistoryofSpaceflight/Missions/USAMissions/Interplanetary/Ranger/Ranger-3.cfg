	description = Ranger 3 was designed to transmit pictures of the lunar surface to Earth stations during a period of 10 minutes of flight prior to impacting on the Moon, to rough-land a seismometer capsule on the Moon, to collect gamma-ray data in flight, to study radar reflectivity of the lunar surface, and to continue testing of the Ranger program for development of lunar and interplanetary spacecraft. Due to a series of malfunctions the spacecraft missed the Moon by 36,800 km and ended up in a heliocentric orbit. It had a mass of 329.8 kg.

	notes = Launch Ranger 3, attempt to impact @targetBody, and end in a heliocentric orbit.
