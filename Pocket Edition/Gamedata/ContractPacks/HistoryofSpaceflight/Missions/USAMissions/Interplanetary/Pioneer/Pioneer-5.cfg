	description = Pioneer 5 (1960 Alpha 1) was a spin-stabilized space probe used to investigate interplanetary space between the orbits of Earth and Venus. The spacecraft measured magnetic field phenomena, solar flare particles, and ionization in the interplanetary region. The digital data were transmitted at 1, 8, and 64 bps, depending on the distance of the spacecraft from the Earth and the size of the receiving antenna. Pioneer 5 achieved a solar orbit of 0.806 x 0.995 AU (121,000,000 by 149,000,000 km). Weight limitations on the solar cells prevented continuous operation of the telemetry transmitters.&br;&br;About four operations of 25-min duration were scheduled per day with occasional increases during times of special interest. Pioneer 5 performed normally until April 30, 1960, after which telemetry transmission became too infrequent for any significant addition to the data. The spacecraft established a communications link with the Earth from a record distance of 22.5 million miles on June 26, 1960, which was the last day of transmission. It had a mass of 43.0 kg.
