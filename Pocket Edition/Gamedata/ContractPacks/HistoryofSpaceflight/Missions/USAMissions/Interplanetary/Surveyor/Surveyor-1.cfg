	description = Surveyor 1 was the first spacecraft launched in the Surveyor program and the first soft landing on the Moon by the United States. The mission was considered a complete success and demonstrated the technology necessary to achieve landing and operations on the lunar surface. The primary objectives of the Surveyor program, a series of seven robotic lunar soft-landing flights, were to support the coming crewed Apollo landings by: developing and validating the technology for landing softly on the Moon; providing data on the compatibility of the Apollo design with conditions encountered on the lunar surface; and adding to the scientific knowledge of the Moon.
