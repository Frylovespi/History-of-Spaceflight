	description = Surveyor 6 was the sixth lunar lander of the American unmanned Surveyor program that reached the surface of the Moon. Surveyor 6 landed on the Sinus Medii on November 10, 1967. Virtually identical to Surveyor 5, this spacecraft carried a television camera, a small bar magnet attached to one footpad, and an alpha-scattering instrument as well as the necessary engineering equipment. Surveyor 6's engines were restarted and burned for 2.5 seconds on November 17 at 10:32 UTC in the first Lunar liftoff. The vehicle lifted off and was hovering 4m above the Lunar surface. After moving west 2.5 m the spacecraft was once again successfully soft landed. The spacecraft continued functioning as designed. On November 24, 1967, the spacecraft was shut down for the 2 week lunar night. Contact was made on December 14, 1967, but no useful data were obtained. A total of 30,027 images were transmitted to Earth.
	
    notes = Launch Surveyor 6 to @targetBody, land on its surface and perform a secondary restart and landing.
