	description = Explorer 15 was a 44 kg spin-stabilized, solar-cell-powered spacecraft instrumented to study the artificial radiation belt produced by the Starfish high-altitude nuclear burst of July 1962. The backup payload for Explorer 14 was modified and used for Explorer 15. The instrumentation included three sets of particle detectors to study both electrons and protons, and a two-axis fluxgate magnetometer to determine magnetic aspect. It was the third of the S 3 series of spacecraft, which also included Explorers 12 and 14.&br;&br;Explorer 15 was placed in a highly elliptical geocentric orbit with an apogee of 17,438 km, a perigee of 300 km, an inclination of 18 degrees, and an orbital period of 311.4 minutes. The mission ended when the spacecraft decayed from orbit on December 19, 1978.
