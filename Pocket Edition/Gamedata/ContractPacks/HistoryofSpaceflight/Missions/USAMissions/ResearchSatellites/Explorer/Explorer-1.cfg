	description = Explorer 1 was the first successfully launched U. S. spacecraft. Launched on an adapted Jupiter-C rocket, Explorer 1 carried instrumentation for the study of cosmic rays, micrometeorites, and for monitoring of the satellite's temperature. The 4.82 kg instrumentation package was mounted inside of the forward section of the rocket body. A single Geiger-Mueller detector was used for the detection of cosmic rays. Micrometeorite detection was accomplished using both a wire grid (arrayed around the aft section of the rocket body) and an acoustic detector (placed in contact with the midsection). Data from the instruments were transmitted continuously, but acquisition was limited to those times when the spacecraft passed over appropriately equipped ground receiving stations. Explorer 1 was the first spacecraft to successfully detect the durably trapped radiation in the Earth's magnetosphere, dubbed the Van Allen Radiation Belt. It had a mass of 13.97 kg.&br;&br;Explorer 1 was placed in a medium Earth orbit on February 1, 1958 at 03:48 UTC from LC-26A at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Range. It had an apogee of 2,550 km, a perigee of 358 km, an inclination of 33.24 degrees, and an orbital period of 114.8 minutes. Contact with Explorer 1 was lost on May 23, 1958 after the batteries died. Explorer 1 remained in orbit as a derelict object for 12 more years before decaying from orbit on March 31, 1970.
