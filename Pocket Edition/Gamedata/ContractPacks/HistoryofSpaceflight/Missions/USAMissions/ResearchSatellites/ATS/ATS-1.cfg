	description = ATS 1 (Applications Technology Satellite) was designed and launched for the purpose of testing new concepts in spacecraft design, propulsion, and stabilization, collecting high-quality cloud cover pictures and relaying processed meteorological data via an earth-synchronous satellite, providing in-situ measurements of the aerospace environment, and testing improved communication systems. The spin-stabilized spacecraft was cylindrical in shape and measured 135 cm long and 142 cm in diameter. It had a mass of 352.0 kg.&br;&br;After entering a geostationary orbit at 37,000 km above Earth, initially in orbit over Ecuador, it transmitted weather images from the Western Hemisphere, as well as other data, to ground stations, including well as video feeds for television broadcasting. "For the first time," historians would note later, "rapid-imaging of nearly an entire hemisphere was possible. We could watch, fascinated, as storm systems developed and moved and were captured in a time series of images. Today such images are an indispensable part of weather analysis and forecasting." The ATS-1 would remain operational for more than 18 years, until April, 1985.
