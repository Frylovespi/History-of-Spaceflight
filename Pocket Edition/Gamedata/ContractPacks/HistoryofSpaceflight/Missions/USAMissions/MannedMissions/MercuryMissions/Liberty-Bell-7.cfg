	description = Mercury Redstone 4 (MR-4, also designated Liberty Bell 7) was the second flight of an American rocket with a human on board (Virgil I. "Gus" Grissom) and the last suborbital manned flight. The objectives of MR-4 were to: familiarize man with a brief but complete space flight experience, including the lift-off, powered flight, weightless flight (approximately 5 minutes), re-entry, and landing phases of the flight; evaluate man's ability to perform as a functional unit during space flight by demonstrating manual control of spacecraft attitude before, during, and after retrofire and by use of voice communications during flight; study man's physiological reactions during space flight; and, qualify the explosively-actuated side egress hatch.		 

	notes = Launch the Liberty Bell 7 carrying Alan B. Shepard on a sub-orbital trajectory and recover the capsule intact.
