    description = Mercury-Redstone 2 (MR-2) was the penultimate test flight of the Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle prior to the first manned American space mission in Project Mercury. Mercury spacecraft No. 5 carried Ham the Chimp, a chimpanzee, on a suborbital flight, landing in the Atlantic Ocean 16 minutes and 39 seconds after launch. Mercury spacecraft No. 5 contained six new systems that had not been on previous flights: environmental control system, attitude stabilization control system, live retrorockets, voice communications system, "closed loop" abort sensing system, and a pneumatic landing bag.&br;&br; Various problems occurred during flight, resulting in overperformance, increased G-loads and cabin pressure. Ham's performance during the flight went well, with reaction times for his required tasks of lever pulling comparable to his pre-flight testing despite his vehicle's performance problems.
