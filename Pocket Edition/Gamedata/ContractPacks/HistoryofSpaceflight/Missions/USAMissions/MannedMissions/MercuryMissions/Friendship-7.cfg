	description = Mercury Atlas 6 (MA-6, also designated Friendship 7) was the first orbital flight of an American rocket with a human on board. The pilot was John H. Glenn, Jr. The objectives of MA-6 were to: evaluate the performance of a man-spacecraft system in a three-orbit mission; evaluate the effects of space flight on the astronaut; and, obtain the astronaut's evaluation of the operational suitability of the spacecraft and supporting systems for manned space flight. During the flight, the spacecraft attained a maximum velocity in excess of 28,000 km/hour and an altitude of about 260 km. The capsule reentered after completing three orbits, coming down in the Atlantic Ocean some 1,300 km southeast of Bermuda. The duration of the flight was 4 hours 55 minutes and 23 seconds during which Glenn travelled over 121,000 km.
