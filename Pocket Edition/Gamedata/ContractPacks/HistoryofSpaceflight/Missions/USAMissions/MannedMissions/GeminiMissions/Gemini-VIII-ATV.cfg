	description = Gemini 8-ATV was the name given to the Agena Target Vehicle that was launched to dock with Gemini 8. The ATV was launched one hour and forty minutes earlier than Gemini 8, into a near circular orbit at around 300 km altitude. The Gemini Agena Target Vehicle was designed to be launched into Earth orbit prior to a Gemini mission and used for rendezvous and docking practice. The GATV had a docking cone at the forward end into which the nose of the Gemini spacecraft could be inserted and held with docking latches.

	notes = Launch the Gemini VIII ATV into orbit. Be sure to leave Gemini-VIII-ATV in orbit for a future mission!
