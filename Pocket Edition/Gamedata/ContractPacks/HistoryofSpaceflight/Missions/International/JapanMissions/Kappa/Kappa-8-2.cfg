	description = The Kappa series represented Japan's first large post-war indigenously developed sounding rockets. They led eventually to the Lambda and Mu solid rocket satellite launchers. Kappa-8-2 was a Two stage vehicle consisting of 1-K420 (34.0 kN) second stage SRB and 1 x Kappa-8-2 (110.0 kN) first stage SRB. It had a height of 6.0 m, a diameter of 0.33 m, a mass of 1500 kg, and could carry a payload of 60 kg to an altitude of 200 km. The second test flight of the Kappa-8 rocket and it reached a successful altitude of 150 km.
