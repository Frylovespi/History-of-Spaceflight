    description = K-150 was a Japanese ISAS sounding rocket. 1/1.6 sub-scale test rocket used in development of the Kappa 9L sounding rockets. It was a single stage rocket. There were a total of 14 K-150 flights from 1958-1962. It had a thrust of 19.00 kN, a mass of 100 kg, a height of 4.00 m, a diameter of 0.15 m. It reached an average altitude of 5-6 km in most tests. In the final test flight on December 20, 1962 a K-150 reached an altitude of 12 km.
