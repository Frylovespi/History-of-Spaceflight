    description = The Black Knight was a British test vehicle designed to test re-entry vehicles for the Blue Streak MRBM. It was subsequently used for a series of US-sponsored test of RV radar signatures. The rocket was required to loft a 115 kg re-entry vehicle shape to an altitude of 800 km for re-entries at 5 km/sec. Two development launches and three RV tests were completed before the Blue Streak was canceled in April 1960. However the vehicle continued in use in a new series of tests sponsored by the United States. These studied the radar signatures of RV's and their plasma trails, crucial in development of early warning and anti-ballistic missile systems. The Black Knight was a two stage sounding rocket. The first stage Gamma-201 engine produced 75.00 kN of thrust for 140 seconds, and the second stage Cuckoo IB produced 80.90 kN of thrust for 4.1s. It had a mass of 5600 kg, a height of 10.0 m, and a diameter of 0.91 m.
