	description = After the success of the Aggregat 2 work began on the Aggregat 3 in 1935 and led again by Wernher Von Braun. The new facility in the Peenem√ºnde area would be the new German testing grounds for their rockets. As with the previous Aggregats the Aggregat3 was to be powered by a liquid oxygen and alcohol fuel mixture. The engine generated 14.7 kN of thrust for 45s. It used a three-gyroscope system to deflect tungsten alloy jet vanes for guidance.&br;&br;The Aggregat 3 had a length of 6.74m and a diameter or 0.68m. There were 2 launches on December 4 1937, and December 6, 1937. One of the missiles reached a downrange distance of 12 km and a max apogee of 18 km.
