	description = San Marco 1, also known as San Marco A, was the first Italian satellite. Built in-house by the Italian Space Research Commission on behalf of the National Research Council. It was the first of five as part of the Italian-US San Marco program. The primary mission of the San Marco series was to conduct ionospheric (upper-atmosphere) research. As a test satellite San Marco 1 contained relatively few experiments. The launch vehicle was provided by NASA and was launched with an Italian launch crew. San Marco 1 had a mass of 115.2 kg.
