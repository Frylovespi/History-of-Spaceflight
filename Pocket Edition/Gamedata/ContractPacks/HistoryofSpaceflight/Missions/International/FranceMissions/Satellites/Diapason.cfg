	description = Diapason was a small cylindrical satellite, 20 cm long and 50 cm in diameter which was used for making geodetic measurements. Observations consisted of doppler delay of radio signals, plus photography of the satellite against the star field. Satellite performance was satisfactory with useful observations occurring for over 5 years.

	notes = Launch the Diapason satellite into orbit.
	synopsis = <color=yellow>Diapason was launched on a Diamant-A rocket from the Hammaguira Space Track Range in Algeria on February 17, 1966.</color>
