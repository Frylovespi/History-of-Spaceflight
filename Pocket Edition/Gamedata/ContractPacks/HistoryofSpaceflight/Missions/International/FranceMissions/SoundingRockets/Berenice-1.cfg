    description = The Berenice sounding rocket was an early rocket produced in France by the Onera company. It was a four stage solid fuelled rocket that had a maximum payload of 40kg and a maximum flight altitude of 1000km. They did not fly to their maximum altitude and instead the fourth stage was used to increase the descent rate for re-entry vehicle design and testing. The 12 Berenice rockets were all launched from 1962-1966.

	notes = Launch the Berenice 1 sounding rocket to an altitude of @/Altitude m and recover the experiment package intact.
