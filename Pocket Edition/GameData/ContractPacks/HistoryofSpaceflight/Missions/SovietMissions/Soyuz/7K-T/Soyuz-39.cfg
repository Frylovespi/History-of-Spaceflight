	description = Soyuz 39 was a 1981 Soviet crewed space flight to the Salyut 6 space station. It was the fifteenth expedition, and carried the eighth international crew to the orbiting facility. The crew visited Vladimir Kovalyonok and Viktor Savinykh, who had reached Salyut-6 ten days prior. The flight carried Vladimir Dzhanibekov and J端gderdemidiin G端rragchaa into space. With this mission, G端rragchaa became the first Mongolian, and second Asian cosmonaut. The Mongolian contribution for this mission had begun in 1967, when the president of the Mongolian Academy of Sciences Bazaryn Shirendev attended a conference of scientists from socialist countries in Moscow, where the Intercosmos project was announced. Dzhanibekov and G端rragchaa performed about thirty experiments during the course of the mission.
