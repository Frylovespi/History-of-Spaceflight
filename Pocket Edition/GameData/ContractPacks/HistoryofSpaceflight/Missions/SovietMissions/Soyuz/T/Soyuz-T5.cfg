	description = Soyuz T-5 was a human spaceflight into Earth orbit to the then new Salyut 7 space station in 1982. While the Soyuz-T was docked it received visits from the uncrewed Progress 13 resupply spacecraft, and the crewed Soyuz T-6 and Soyuz T-7. The Soyuz T-5 spacecraft docked with Salyut 7 in orbit, and it was visited by the 2nd and 3rd expeditions to the space station. One advantage the new Salyut 7 station had over Salyut 6, was continuously available hot water. &br;&br;The Elbrus crew ejected a 28-kg amateur radio satellite, called Iskra-2, from a Salyut 7 trash airlock on May 17, 1982. The Soviets called this the first launch of a communications satellite from a crewed space vehicle. They did this ahead of the launch of two large geostationary satellites from the U.S. Space Shuttle (STS-5, November 11â€“16, 1982). The Soyuz T-5 spacecraft was undocked in August 1982, leaving Salyut 7 and Soyuz T-7 spacecraft in orbit. The spacecraft returned to Earth successfully with Popov, Serebrov and Savitskaya, also called the "Dneiper crew". The Soyuz T-5 had been in space six weeks. The initial "Elbrus crew", would return to Earth in the Soyuz T-7 spacecraft in December 1982.
