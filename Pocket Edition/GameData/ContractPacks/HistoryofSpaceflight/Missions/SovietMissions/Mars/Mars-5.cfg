	description = Mars 5, also known as 3MS No.53S, was a Soviet spacecraft launched to explore Mars. A 3MS spacecraft launched as part of the Mars program, it successfully entered orbit around Mars in 1974. However, it failed a few weeks later.&br;&br;
	
	The probe reached Mars on 12 February. At 14:44:25 the spacecraft's engines ignited to begin its orbit insertion burn, which successfully placed it into an Areocentric orbit with a periapsis of 1,760 kilometres (1,090 mi), an apoapsis of 32,586 kilometres (20,248 mi), and 35.3 degrees inclination. The spacecraft's pressurised instrument compartment began to leak as soon as the spacecraft entered orbit around Mars, which controllers believed to be the result of a micrometeoroid impact during orbital insertion. It ceased operations on 28 February, having returned 180 photographic frames, 43 of which were of usable quality. The probe also made a number of observations of Mars's atmosphere. It found an ozone layer at an altitude of 30km and observed clouds.
