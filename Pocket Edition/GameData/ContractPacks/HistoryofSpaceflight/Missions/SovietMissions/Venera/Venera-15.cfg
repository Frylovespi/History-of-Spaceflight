	description = Venera 15, also designated 4V-2 No.860, was part of another dual mission to Venus, paired with Venera 16, launched in June 1983. Both spacecraft carried identical instrumentation and were based on modifications to the orbiter portions of the Venera 9-14 probes. Different from previous Venera missions was the absence of lander probes. The two spacecraft were inserted into Venus orbit a day apart with their orbital planes shifted by an angle of approximately 4 degrees relative to one another. This made it possible to reimage an area if necessary. Each spacecraft was in a nearly polar orbit with a periapsis at 62° N latitude. Together, the two spacecraft imaged the area from the north pole down to about 30° N latitude over the 8 months of mapping operations. Both Venera 15 and 16 were equipped with a synthetic-aperture radar (SAR). A radar was necessary in this mission because nothing else would be able to penetrate the dense clouds of Venus. The probes were equipped with on board computers that saved the images until the entire image was complete. This radar system replaced the normal landers that previous Venera probes brought to Venus.
